Life switched up on me crazy when I lost my dad and my brother. It's just like the weight was on my shoulders and it forced me to sell my childhood just to provide for my family."</p><p>The singer stressed that after being thrust into adulthood, he found himself constantly surrounded by adults and never had a chance to experience childhood and make the mistakes his agemates made.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>He continued, "I also thought maybe after hustling and doing my little beats in Ghana, and all the little hustles I put my hands into, I thought it was going to end there but music picked up. I then had to go on to that end and grind and grind. God willing, everything happened well and happened fast. With fast fame came fast maturity and it's like a never-ending level of seriousness. There were so many adults and so many meetings, that I didn't even roll with my agemates."</p><p>Rema revealed that <a href=# id=52873092-31de-4066-8593-c3072ba29f2e data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>his new album, HEIS</a>, which is different from his other works, is an outlet for him to be a child again.</p><p>He explained, "I'm not sure I even rolled with the 19 or 18-year-olds. When I was 17, I didn't see a fellow 17-year-old, and when I was 20, everyone was five, six, or ten years older. Now with this project, I just want to be a child and it's just coming out. I just want to feel young again and be a rebel again. I just got tired and I put that freedom in my music."</p><p>See the full interview below:</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGaiZZensrh51KlkraefYrOiv9NmqZ6lkWK8r3nLqKqippditaq%2FjJ%2BYraCVp3qiusNmmaunpJ2ys3vNa6eqspib</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./qualite-de-lair-dans-les-ecoles-aerer-cest-depolluer.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Qualit de l'air dans les coles : arer, c'est dpolluer</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-money-does-nick-cave-make-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Much Money Does Nick Cave Make?
