He managed to get out the first line of the song “This is a man’s world” before Nick Jonas and John Legend pressed their buttons in record time. The pair turned their chairs so quickly, it took a second to process what just happened. John stood up on his feet dancing as Mike’s performance was full of soul.</p><p>It took one high note to turn coach Kelly Clarkson’s chair. The coaches all encouraged Blake to turn his chair as he listened intently. During the last line of the song, Blake turned his chair making it the first four-chair turn of the night.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>5 FACTS ABOUT ‘THE VOICE’ FRONTRUNNER MIKE JEREL</a></strong></p><p>John immediately connected with him and said he could hear that he has a lot of influences singing in church in his voice and tone. “Everything you did was done with such a level of confidence, note for note, you had a plan, you knew where you wanted to go…I would absolutely love to coach you,” he said. It was no surprise that Mike chose to be on Team Legend. “Choosing John as a coach was a no-brainer for me,” he told us. “I felt that he would understand me as an artist, and would be a huge asset to guide me in the right direction.”</p><p>During The Battles, Mike performed “Adorn” against Zach Day and came out on top. He then went on to perform “Versace on the Floor” during The Knockouts. He advanced to the Live Playoffs where he was then eliminated.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2s8uticA0o</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Where Is He Now?</h3><p>After appearing on The Voice and having one of the most iconic auditions of all time, Mike continues to post covers on YouTube.
