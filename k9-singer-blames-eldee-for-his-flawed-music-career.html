But kokoma didn’t get a video,” he wrote, faulting eLDee for trivialising his hard work and sweat.</p><p>K9 was discovered in 2011 when Trybe Records hosted a music talent hunt tagged <strong>‘Top talent’</strong>. The winners, <strong>Sojay</strong> and K9 were both signed to the record label afterwards.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>His debut single ‘Kokoma,’ which got him mainstream recognition in the industry, was consequently released in September 2012. Even without a video for over one year, the song thrived and became one of the major hits at the time.</p><p>Eventually, a supposed 'Kokoma' video surfaced online, but Trybe Records swiftly countered that the video wasn't meant to be released yet, noting it was a leak. The label reportedly said the video was not finished. And that was the end of 'Kokoma' visuals, and subsequently K9, as the artiste somewhat fizzled out of the scene until lately.</p><p>“I could blame eldee for these things and I’d be justified, because I know I worked my ass off to record lots of songs. All the ppl who came to trybe studio in oniru know. Only God knows the truth about what happened and why eldee and the trybe board didn’t shoot that video,”&nbsp;K9 said.</p><p>With his contemporaries, Olamide, Wizkid, Davido, Phyno and others dictating what, how and when they want to be paid, flaunting wards of cash and luxury accessories on social media at intervals, flying in private jets and updating their garage with the latest automobiles&nbsp;in town, it would almost be impossible for any talented and budding artiste not to feel pressured.</p><p>Read his full outburst below:</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>“Evening fam. Today I’m pained about many things and I’m going to speak my mind. Anyone who knows me knows I run away from drama. But there’s so many things I’ve left unsaid all this time and I’m going to put it all out there today coz everyone keeps asking me the same question. “What happened with me and eldee and trybe records.” Let everyone know the kokoma story.</p><p>At this stage in my career I should be making more money than I am, and the K9 name & brand should be bigger than it is. But kokoma didn’t get a video, so ppl don’t know what I look like and therefore my face can’t sellout shows. And I didn’t drop a follow-up dance single under trybe so the kokoma buzz died down.</p><p>I could blame eldee for these things and I’d be justified, because I know I worked my ass off to record lots of songs. All the ppl who came to trybe studio in oniru know. Only God knows the truth about what happened and why eldee and the trybe board didn’t shoot that video. Because I’ve heard different versions from different trybe “insiders”. But I can’t bite the hand that wanted to feed me. Trybe records gave me a chance in the industry. Ppl don’t know but eldee didn’t have to sign me. He only wanted to sign the winner of top talent and that was @therealsojay . I got signed thanks to efforts by @musiqlovart who sent songs in for the competition, and @beatsbysarz my friend since 2008 at least, who played my material to eldee at eldee’s house. I was still a trainee at access bank training school, working 7am to 10pm. I didn’t have the time to do these things. I was new in the game and didn’t know the hustle well, otherwise I’d have known to hustle and shoot a video for my song by myself.</p><p>So, @eldeethedon it’ll take time and the grace of God for me to forget, but I’ve moved on from all that. The things you said about me to @iam2shotz were unnecessary, but let’s say everyone was a little confused then and keep it moving. Now you all know, I’m tired of answering this question in every interview,This issue ends here pls. Thanks. My new single is on its way. #CoupDEtat is coming. Let’s Take-Over this year. #CDE #BigBaby #YoungLion Bless.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6mrKyhk2S4ennSoqWgnaJir62tzJ6qZp2cmbKmecWoqWagmah6p7jAsJydZZ2qwKqvjJyYq52Vp3yvwMqlr6mg</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./17395-brits-and-germans-want-see-burqa-banned-whilst-ame.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Brits and Germans want to see the burqa banned, whilst Americans defend the right to choose</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./it-ends-with-us-review-blake-lively-1236097332.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>It Ends with Us Review: Blake Lively Stars in a Romantic Soap Opera That Turns Dark and</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fontainebleau.html>Fontainebleau: Worlds Greatest Places 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-much-money-does-yung-joc-make-html.html>How Much Money Does Yung Joc Make?
