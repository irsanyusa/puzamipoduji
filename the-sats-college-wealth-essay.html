Colleges touted the shift as progressive. “Students have never been treated as numbers,” Colorado College <a href=#>posted</a> on its website. “Our test-optional policy allows our team to identify the most qualified candidates for admission while also increasing access for first-generation, low-income, and traditionally underserved students.” Even Harvard was on board. “People somehow think that if you don’t have test scores it’s very hard to evaluate an application, but you have teacher reports, you have grades,” Harvard’s admissions dean Bill Fitzsimmons <a href=#>said</a> in 2022. “There’s an enormous amount of academic information.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision in SFFA v. Harvard, which effectively ended race-based affirmative action, it was possible to envision career-defining standardized testing heading for the scrap bin of history, too. After all, the SAT and ACT have long been known to correlate closely with wealth. One recent <a href=#>study</a> found that students from families in the top 1% of the income distribution are 13 times more likely than students from the bottom 20 percent to score 1300 or higher on the SAT. Just 2.5% of students from the lowest income quintile manage to reach 1300.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">If colleges wanted to preserve diversity—and could no longer consider an applicant’s race—surely they could no longer place great weight on a metric that functions principally as a marker of the applicant’s wealth.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Not so fast.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Elite colleges are whistling quite a different tune than they were just two years ago. The reimplementation of standardized testing has coincided with a spate of personal <a href=#>anecdotes</a>, <a href=#>research</a>, and <a href=#>articles</a> extolling their putative benefits. Christina Paxson, the president of Brown University, recently <a href=#>touted</a> the SAT and ACT for revealing “useful information about whether students will, on average, be academically successful at Brown.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=#>I Took the SAT Again in My 50s. Turns Out I Had Learned Nothing</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">One could understand the need for standardized testing at public colleges, where <a href=#>more than a third</a> of entering students fail to graduate within six years. But it’s a curious argument to be advanced by Brown, where the six-year <a href=#>graduation rate</a> is 96% and for Pell Grant recipients is 93%.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Another line of defense is that the SAT is the best friend of the downtrodden. Harvard economist David Deming <a href=#>said</a>, “My worry is that if we get rid of the SAT, you’re getting rid of the only way that a low-income student who’s academically talented has to distinguish themselves.” It’s again a curious argument to be made, especially by schools like Brown and Harvard, each of which counts itself among the <a href=#>38 American colleges</a> where more students come from families in the top 1% of the income distribution than the bottom 60%. This is true even though Brown has an endowment of <a href=#>$6.6 billion</a> and Harvard the nation’s largest—<a href=#>$50.9 billion</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It's even more curious, still, given that in the same <a href=#>letter</a> in which Paxson announced the return to standardized testing, she reaffirmed Brown’s commitment to early decision—which has long been <a href=#>known</a> to hurt poorer students who can’t afford to commit to a college without comparing financial aid packages—and to the preference it affords to the children, of alumni, donors, faculty, staff, and athletic recruits—pathways that overwhelmingly benefit rich, white applicants, otherwise known as “ALDC” applicants. At Harvard, for example, 43% of white students are “ALDC.” <a href=#>Research</a> shows that about three quarters of these students would have been rejected without their ALDC status.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=#>The Case Against Private College Admissions Counselors</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">So what’s really going on?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">To understand, one need only take a closer look at the most widely cited study by Deming and his colleagues Raj Chetty and John Friedman. Standardized test scores, the story goes, are a much better predictor of college success than high school GPA. What are their principal markers of “college success?” Attending an “elite graduate school” and “working at a prestigious firm.” The outcome they’re looking at is the accumulation of wealth not knowledge. Is it any surprise that rich kids both outperform lower-SES kids on the SAT and at getting investment banking jobs at Goldman Sachs and consulting jobs at McKinsey?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">What if these researchers and college administrators instead adopted this definition of success: the student maintained a college GPA of over 3.0, learned and grew as a person, and got a significant benefit in terms of economic mobility? By this standard, virtually every socioeconomically disadvantaged kid admitted to one of these prestigious, highly endowed colleges is a success.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But this interpretation of the data and definition of the object of college would be decidedly inconvenient and mask the true object of elite colleges: to make rich kids richer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvcWZtf3KEjq2fnmWjlsG0ecKoo6Wdl5p6uLHApauhZZWowKLFjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./voters-dont-necessarily-think-pleading-the-fifth-implies-guilt-but-it-varies-by-party.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Voters Dont Necessarily Think Pleading the Fifth Implies Guilt, But It Varies by Party</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./nouvelle-parution-conjoncture-ndeg78-tout-savoir-sur-lactualite-economique-et-immobiliere.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Nouvelle parution : Conjoncture n78</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fontainebleau.html>Fontainebleau: Worlds Greatest Places 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-much-money-does-yung-joc-make-html.html>How Much Money Does Yung Joc Make?
