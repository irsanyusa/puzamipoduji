One particular episode of the show attracted 360 million viewers.</p><p class=align-left>After the seventh season, the actor chose to leave the show. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">According to him</a>, he didn’t want to be typecast as the token good boy. He wanted to be known for more than being a Dallas actor. Since his career was at its peak at the time, he thought that it would be easy for him to venture out and do something new. Considering Patrick Duffy age at the time, he stood a chance of reinventing himself.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4880a3778b657987.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The fascinating story of John Krasinski: what is "The Office" star up to?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Patrick’s expectations turned out to be far from reality.
