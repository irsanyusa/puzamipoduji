However, their careers kept them apart too frequently to&nbsp;create the marriage they had envisioned, which led to&nbsp;their divorce in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>1998</a>.</p><p>The duo remained close friends while continuing to&nbsp;co-parent their kids.

We&nbsp;realize we&nbsp;have a&nbsp;lifelong commitment to&nbsp;our kids. Our friendship continues.”</p><p>There is&nbsp;no&nbsp;animosity between Demi and Bruce, who are, in&nbsp;fact, closer than ever. The 2&nbsp;parents have always put forth a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;effort to&nbsp;give their daughters a&nbsp;happy childhood in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;maintain the <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a>’s unity and strength.</p><p><h2>The age gap between Demi and Ashton</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/05c/078/cf4c125e37bb4c9a1a2f702a72.jpg><p>face to face/Reporter/ East News</p><p>They were one of&nbsp;the most iconic couples of&nbsp;the early 2000s, not only due to&nbsp;their fame but also because Demi was 40&nbsp;at the time they met, and Kutcher was only 25. However, when Demi and Ashton ran into each other at&nbsp;a&nbsp;casual dinner in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2003</a>, it&nbsp;was love at&nbsp;first sight.</p><p>The age difference caused quite a&nbsp;stir at&nbsp;the time, but the couple was more in&nbsp;love than ever. The actress had confessed, “We&nbsp;couldn’t feel&nbsp;it. We&nbsp;were totally in&nbsp;sync from our very first conversation.” So&nbsp;2&nbsp;years after their first meeting, the couple got married in&nbsp;a&nbsp;huge ceremony that also included Demi’s ex-husband, Bruce Willis.</p><p><h2>Ashton’s bond with her daughters and the divorce</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8b1/73f/3d20235c8fb749c00d8743a4df.jpg><p>When Ashton first appeared in&nbsp;Demi’s life, her daughters developed a&nbsp;strong attachment to&nbsp;him, and the famous actors worked hard from the start to&nbsp;establish a&nbsp;close bond with the girls. As&nbsp;Demi’s husband, he&nbsp;had an&nbsp;enormous influence on&nbsp;bringing up&nbsp;and guiding them through adolescence.</p><p>Unfortunately, the couple struggled to&nbsp;maintain their union, and 6&nbsp;years after getting married, they parted ways. Demi made the following claims in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>statement</a>: “It&nbsp;is&nbsp;with great sadness and a&nbsp;heavy heart that&nbsp;I have ended my&nbsp;6-year marriage to&nbsp;Ashton.” They completed the divorce settlement 2&nbsp;years later, in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2013</a>.</p><p>Even after splitting from Demi years later, Ashton maintained his connection with her daughters. Indeed, years later, he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>declared</a>, “I&nbsp;love them, and I’m never going to&nbsp;stop loving them and rooting for them to&nbsp;be&nbsp;successful in&nbsp;whatever they are pursuing.”</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;toxic marriage</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/39e/7a2/574d2c51bebfe44ccbc6de7fcb.jpg><p>Dennis Van Tine/LFI/EAST NEWS</p><p>Despite many infidelity rumors swirling around the time Demi and Ashton divorced, Demi opened up&nbsp;about it&nbsp;only after several years in&nbsp;her book, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Inside Out</i></a>. The actress admits she had “never been so&nbsp;happy” before meeting Ashton, but that things began to&nbsp;fall apart after she miscarried a&nbsp;few months later and had to&nbsp;deal with some addictions in&nbsp;the interim.</p><p>The <i>Ghost</i> star <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a>, “It&nbsp;was my&nbsp;fault, I&nbsp;felt for sure [...] I&nbsp;was racked with guilt and convinced what had happened was my&nbsp;doing.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7b7/dcc/ab6b205d30b85c44012702cc41.jpg><p>AFP/EAST NEWS<span>, </span>PictureGroup/Sipa USA/East News</p><p>Few things came out of&nbsp;Demi’s marriage, which caused her to&nbsp;lose her self-esteem. Ashton’s extramarital relationships made this worse, and the actress began to&nbsp;settle for circumstances that would keep her husband close. “I&nbsp;put him first. I&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wanted</a> to&nbsp;show him how great and fun&nbsp;I could&nbsp;be.”</p><p>On&nbsp;the other hand, following their divorce, Ashton married Mila Kunis, with whom he&nbsp;has 2&nbsp;children. The actor never really responded to&nbsp;Demi’s words, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stating</a> once that his only thoughts are for his children and wife.</p><p><h2>She rediscovered herself.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fbc/673/73eaff5b34bc4fe045f0be9a09.jpg><p>Dee Cercone/Everett Collection / East News</p><p>Even though her romantic life didn’t turn out the way she had hoped, Demi has put a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;effort into becoming the person she is&nbsp;today.

Indeed, Demi’s self-discovery journey has led her to&nbsp;a&nbsp;new, solid relationship with Daniel Humm, who she has been dating since the beginning of&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>year</a>.</p><p>Demi has always gone above and beyond to&nbsp;please the man she was with. “I&nbsp;changed myself to&nbsp;fit what somebody else wanted,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>confessed</a> in&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview.</p><p>“I&nbsp;think the thing is&nbsp;if&nbsp;I were to&nbsp;look back, I&nbsp;would say&nbsp;I blinded myself and&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>I lost myself</a>.” She gradually realized that pursuing her passions and focusing on&nbsp;developing a&nbsp;relationship with herself was the most effective way for her to&nbsp;love herself even more.</p><p>Have you ever found yourself stuck in&nbsp;a&nbsp;negative relationship?
