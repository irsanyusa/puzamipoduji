The stories are all briefâ€”five, six, eight pages; the longest one, The Doves’Nest (unfinished) runs as many as 15. They have no trimly tailored tightness of plotâ€”cannon cracker climaxesâ€”in fact it is doubtful whether any of our best paying and most financially successful American magazines would consider them worth the buying. And yet they add, if anything, to a reputation that already belongs among the permanent things of English literatureâ€”a reputation sustained entirely by exactly such work as this.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">What is there left to analyze, then, when one tries to pull them apart? A moodâ€”a momentâ€”a fragranceâ€” sorrowâ€”joyâ€”a living man, a living woman, suddenly, completely seen.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Stories. The Doll’s House deals with a wonderful doll’s house given to some moderately well-to-do children. They treasure itâ€”show it off to all their school friends except the little Kelveys, the washerwoman’s daughters. Then one day the Kelveys do see itâ€”and are almost instantly scolded away by a proper grownup. But they have seen it. The children in The Doll’s House live and breatheâ€”Katherine Mansfield told a little about them but not nearly all.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In Taking the Veil, 18-year-old Edna is very unhappy. She thought she loved Jimmy, but last night she went to the theatre and fell in love with an actor. Of course the only thing left for her to do is to take the veil. Then she realizes as she pictures a death in the odor of sanctity that she really does love Jimmy after all.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In The Fly a man kills a fly; in A Cup of Tea, Rosemary Fell, young, wealthy, plays lady bountiful to a starving girl and takes her home for tea. Her husband comments casually that the girl is really astonishingly pretty and Rosemary gives her money and sends her away at once.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">You see? No ginger! No big thumping words! No potency!</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Significance. Life seen with exquisite clarity, subtlety, thoughtfulness, humor, sometimes with scorn or sorrow, but never with spite or despair. Unerring felicity of word and lineâ€”work so beautifully, unobtrusively apt and accomplished that beside it most contemporary prose seems careless and shoddy. And yet the technique is not allâ€”is merely an instrumentâ€”is never brittleâ€”the insight pierces deep and is very clear. A world built up of tiny, crystalline fragmentsâ€”but a world that will remain when many great fictional constellations now spinning in the literary void have expired like wet fireworks.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Critics. John Galsworthy: “Her talent was unique among us. . . . her work stirs and excites us, and so quietly; it is an expression of the mood in love with life. It has the rare flavor that endures. Beautiful work! ”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">H. G. Wells: ” K. M.’s perfectly lovely mind has lit a whole dismal day for me. . . . I put K. M. above the world of effort and compromise.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Christian Science Monitor: ” A treasury of riches. One reads and marvels. … Her writing is of that exquisite, subtle insight that explains us to ourselves.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Author. Katherine Mansfield (Kathleen Beauchamp) was born in Wellington, New Zealand, and died at Fontainebleau, France (Jan. 9, 1923), at the age of 34. Her first book, In a German Pension, appeared in 1911, in England, when she was 21. In 1913 she married J. Middleton Murry, English critic, editor, novelist. Her other books are Bliss and Other Stories (1920) and The Garden Party (1922). At the time of her death she had just become universally recognized as the foremost writer of short stories in English.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Necrology</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Eight Wielders of the Pen Meet at Last the Wielder of the Scythe</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Penmanship is the occasion of comparatively few occupational diseases. Yet during the early months of 1923 mortality has been high in the literary fraternity. At least eight well-known names have joined the roster of the dead. It is noteworthy, however, that all but one of these passed away ripe in years. The exception is Katherine Mansfield, whose death came upon her in mid-career. The others are:</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Maurice Hewlett (Jan. 22, 1861), English novelist, poet, critic. The Forest Lovers, a medieval romance published in 1898, established Hewlett’s reputation in a field in which, despite the wave of imitation that followed its success, he still remains among the most eminent. Other medieval novels include Richard Yea-and-Nay, The Song of Renny and The Queen’s Quair, which deals with Mary, Queen of Scots.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Alice Meynell, poet and essayist, leader in the English Catholic literary movement. Her Poems and A Father of Women display intense, controlled emotion, often devotional in subject. The Rhythm of Life and The Second Person Singular are essays. Her husband, Wilfrid Meynell, and herself rescued the poet, Francis Thompson, from starvation.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Pierre Loti (Louis Marie Julien Viaud), French novelist, sculptor, painter, musician, Academician and Naval officer (Jan. 14, 1850). Author of Le mariage de Loti, Le Roman d’un Spahi, PÃªcheur d’lslande, Mon FrÃ¨re Yves and other colorful novels, frequently drawn from his own experiences in the tropics. Loti’s literary influence waned perceptibly during his last years.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Kate Douglas Wiggin (Mrs. George C. Riggs), author and playwright (Sept. 28,1859). Besides writing the ever-popular The Birds’ Christmas Carol and Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm, she was also a pioneer in certain charitable work and organized the first free kindergarten on the Pacific Coast.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Emerson Hough, American novelist (June 28, 1857), author of the story now cinematized as The Covered Wagon, North of 36 and other western stories.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Henry Edward Krehbiel, dean of New York music critics (March 10, 1854), author of How to Listen to Music.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sir William Robertson Nicoll (Claudius Clear) (Oct. 10, 1851), editor The British Weekly.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">*THE DOVES’ NESTâ€”The late Katherine Mansfieldâ€”Knopf ($2.50).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmaaqpOdtrexjm9tbXFobIFwwMeeZJ2npprAbrrErKtmo5Gptaa%2ByKecZqWRo8CntcSlm2adqKW5orXNrGSuq12pvG671KuqnqSmmsBw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./une-loi-de-finances-rectificative-pour-le-grand-emprunt.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Une loi de finances rectificative pour le grand emprunt</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./house-of-marley-audio-portable-speakers-review-deal-1235703263.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sound Is Shining: House of Marleys Sustainable Bamboo Speakers Are On Sale for $75</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fontainebleau.html>Fontainebleau: Worlds Greatest Places 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-much-money-does-yung-joc-make-html.html>How Much Money Does Yung Joc Make?
