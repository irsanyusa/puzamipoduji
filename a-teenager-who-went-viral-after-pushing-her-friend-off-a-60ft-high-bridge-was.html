He noted the severity of Jordan Holgerson's injuries during the sentencing.</p><p>The 16-year-old victim punctured both lungs and broke six ribs in the fall, according to <a href=# id=87febd6a-0918-319a-a61c-b10d7fe01953>the Associated Press</a> .</p><p>A viral clip revealed the moments before the incident that occurred in Moulton Falls Regional Park, Washington, last August.

"She did not show up at the hospital to check on Jordan."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Smith also addressed the court, and apologized to the Holgerson family.</p><p>"Although it may have seemed like my intent was to harm [and like] I may have moved on without putting any punishment on myself, this is false," she said.
