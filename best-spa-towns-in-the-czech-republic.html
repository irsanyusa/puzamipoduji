Today, we bring you five tips on where to go when you need to relax, recharge and restart.</p><h2><strong>Karlovy Vary</strong></h2><p>Karlovy Vary is undoubtedly the most famous Czech spa town. It is located in the western part of the country, approximately 2 hours away from Prague. The thermal springs in Karlovy Vary were discovered in the 14th century and have attracted tourists from all over the world since then. The local hot spring water is used not only for bathing, but also for drinking, as it has numerous health benefits. Visitors can enjoy the natural springs by staying in one of the spa resorts or while taking a walk at one of the five colonnades which house the seeps of the mineral springs, for example the Mill Colonnade.</p><p>There are several beautiful hotels in the town center, where guests can enjoy various wellness procedures and medical treatments, but also sports activities such as tennis, golf and horse riding. Apart from its natural springs, Karlovy Vary is also well-known for hosting the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival which takes place every June.</p><p><img alt=karlovy-vary-downtown_63253-744 decoding=async height=799 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.vysokeskoly.cz/czech-universities/uploads/2019/09/karlovy-vary-downtown_63253-744.jpg width=1200 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><strong>Mariánské Lázně</strong></h2><p>Marianske Lazne is another town in the western part of the Czech Republic, about 171 kilometres away from Prague. It is characterized by its beautiful spa parks, romantic colonnades, charming pavilions and cozy hotels. There are 40 springs that rise from the ground within the town and are used in numerous spa treatments available for visitors. The local springs help treat various illnesses, including metabolic disorders, respiratory problems, oncological disorders and disorders of the kidneys.</p><p>Marianske Lazne is a relatively young spa town, having developed in the 19th century when the first spa house was built for visitors. Nevertheless, the town is visited by thousands of tourists every year as it offers not only natural mineral springs, but also beautiful architecture, magnificent parks and access to several sports, cultural and entertainment experiences.</p><h2><strong>Františkovy Lázně</strong></h2><p>Yet again one more spa town in the western part of the country. Františkovy Lázně boasts elegant neo-classical colonnades, well-maintained parks, and the world’s first mud spa. There are 20 natural springs in the town which are used for various medical and wellness treatments.</p><p>The history of the mineral water in Františkovy Lázně dates back to early 16th century. The historic town center of Františkovy Lázně has been under monumental protection since 1992 and was nominated for inclusion in the UNESCO World Heritage list. One of the town’s frequent visitors used to be the famous Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, who described the town as “heaven on earth”. Come and see for yourself, whether Františkovy Lázně truly is a paradise!</p><p><img alt=243_10_1360237022_449773_max decoding=async height=675 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.vysokeskoly.cz/czech-universities/uploads/2019/09/243_10_1360237022_449773_max.jpg width=1200 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><strong>Poděbrady</strong></h2><p>Podebrady lies on the banks of the Elbe River, only 50 km east of Prague. Surrounded by meadows, woods, a natural park and stylish cafés, this spa town has been one of the most popular Czech spa destinations for over a century now. The spas in Podebrady have been curing illnesses of the heart, circulatory system, and blood vessels with the local ferrous mineral water since 1908.</p><p>Although it may sound that Podebrady are an ideal destination for the older generation rather than the youth, the town has a lot to offer to young visitors, too. First of all, Podebrady is less than an hour away from the capital city, which makes it a great one day trip destination for students residing in Prague. Second, the town offers many outdoor activities, e.g. swimming in one of the lakes, biking by the river, and riding horses in the park. Also, several cultural events take place along the colonnades, including symphony orchestra concerts and chamber music recitals.</p><h2><strong>Luhačovice</strong></h2><p>Luhačovice is the largest spa in Moravia and one of the most beautiful spa towns in the Czech Republic. Over 300 years of tradition, its unique architecture and one of the top reputations for treating the diseases of the respiratory tract make Luhačovice a holiday destination for visitors young and old, native and foreign. There are over 10 mineral springs in Luhačovice, the most known of them being Vincentka.</p><p>The town hosts a music Festival Janáček and Luhačovice each year, which was inspired by the musical composer Leoš Janáček who had stayed in Luhačovice regularly and composed there. Visitors of Luhačovice can also enjoy various sports activities, as the town is surrounded by the mountains White Carpathians.</p><p><img alt=luhač decoding=async height=496 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.vysokeskoly.cz/czech-universities/uploads/2019/09/luha%C4%8D.jpg width=1200 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pMbEnJ%2BuppmrsrO%2FyK2gnqtemLyue8Crq6KbnJp8o7HSrWSsqJFiwbDDzaxkoqZdqbWmecKznJygXaeyscHBpaCc</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./cillian-murphy-small-things-like-these-28-days-later-sequels-1235902399.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Cillian Murphy on Taking an Awards Season Break With Berlin Opener Small Things Like These,</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./german-rock-bands.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The 5 greatest German rock bands of all time</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fontainebleau.html>Fontainebleau: Worlds Greatest Places 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-much-money-does-yung-joc-make-html.html>How Much Money Does Yung Joc Make?
