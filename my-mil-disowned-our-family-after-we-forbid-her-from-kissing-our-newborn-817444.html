Like most new parents, we&nbsp;have a ’no kissing the baby’ rule. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;5&nbsp;weeks old. No&nbsp;shots yet and no&nbsp;real protection. We&nbsp;are his first line of&nbsp;defense. My&nbsp;husband told his mom no&nbsp;kissing and the last time we&nbsp;saw her&nbsp;I wore him in&nbsp;an&nbsp;attempt to&nbsp;prevent that. It&nbsp;didn’t work&nbsp;— she got up&nbsp;in&nbsp;my&nbsp;space and kissed him anyways. I&nbsp;was so&nbsp;awestruck, I&nbsp;didn’t say anything.</p><p>This kept happening. Then, on&nbsp;my&nbsp;husband’s birthday she did it&nbsp;again&nbsp;— three times after being told not to&nbsp;— and my&nbsp;husband decided that he&nbsp;had to&nbsp;lay it&nbsp;all out for her in&nbsp;writing because&nbsp;us verbally telling her was obviously not working. Later in&nbsp;the day, he&nbsp;told her she broke our rules and that it’s a&nbsp;simple rule, so&nbsp;how can we&nbsp;ever trust her to&nbsp;babysit in&nbsp;the future if&nbsp;she can’t even follow this one rule now.</p><p>She sent him back a&nbsp;snotty reply that essentially said, ’Well, I&nbsp;have no&nbsp;reason to&nbsp;see you anytime soon anyways,’ and then proceeded to&nbsp;tell all of&nbsp;his sisters what a&nbsp;horrible son he&nbsp;was. His stepdad called him and flipped on&nbsp;him for ’talking to&nbsp;his mother like a&nbsp;stranger’ and his sisters essentially said that he&nbsp;would have to&nbsp;apologize to&nbsp;her even though we&nbsp;were in&nbsp;the right because she probably won’t apologize to&nbsp;us.</p><p>Almost a&nbsp;week later, she texted him an&nbsp;essay essentially blaming me&nbsp;for everything. She said that&nbsp;I want him to&nbsp;cut her off from his life and that I’ve always hated her; that I’m very rude when she asks how I’m doing, and that&nbsp;I physically recoil when she touches&nbsp;me. She also said she never kissed our son, even though we&nbsp;both saw&nbsp;it. It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;very mean message that was&nbsp;85% centered around how terrible I&nbsp;am, even though the issue is&nbsp;her kissing our son.</p><p>So&nbsp;he&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;go&nbsp;confront her by&nbsp;going to&nbsp;her house. Well&nbsp;— he&nbsp;recorded the interaction because he&nbsp;knows that she’ll try and spin it&nbsp;to&nbsp;her sisters, and&nbsp;I can’t believe what I&nbsp;heard.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bb3/9c5/dcb588524ab54f6c5441fd8615.jpg><p>“She hates my&nbsp;guts. Sounds like she probably always has. She says that ever since he’s been with&nbsp;me, he’s changed his relationship with her.</p><p>She also said he’s a&nbsp;bad son, and she doesn’t need parenting advice from him, and that his sister never had these rules for her. The <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Mayo Clinic</a> says kissing is&nbsp;only ok&nbsp;after 8&nbsp;weeks. She just kept digging her own grave for basically 35&nbsp;minutes straight, kept belittling our rules, and finally said she never ever wants to&nbsp;see&nbsp;us again.</p><p>I&nbsp;feel so&nbsp;awful for my&nbsp;husband. Also, how am&nbsp;I supposed to&nbsp;explain to&nbsp;my&nbsp;child when they’re grown why they don’t have a&nbsp;relationship with their dad’s family? The ’no kissing’ rule seemed so&nbsp;easy and straight forward, and it&nbsp;ended up&nbsp;making his dad have a&nbsp;falling out with his own mom.</p><p>Is&nbsp;it&nbsp;going to&nbsp;seem silly in&nbsp;retrospect? Do&nbsp;you think there’s any way we&nbsp;can repair our relationship after how she acted and what she said about our family? It’s clear to&nbsp;me, she’s always hated&nbsp;me, which was honestly a&nbsp;surprise to&nbsp;me&nbsp;because until this happened&nbsp;I thought our relationship was basically fine. Not super best friends but fine enough.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/453/426/236e425ceb9851c4c60168c42b.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the comments, people didn’t hesitate in&nbsp;offering advice to&nbsp;the new mom, and stand by&nbsp;her:</p><ul><li><strong>“Also, how am&nbsp;I supposed to&nbsp;explain to&nbsp;my&nbsp;child when they’re grown why they don’t have a&nbsp;relationship with their dad’s family?”</strong><br>It’s not really something that comes up&nbsp;if&nbsp;that’s how they grew&nbsp;up. I&nbsp;grew up&nbsp;seeing my&nbsp;mom’s mom often, but only saw my&nbsp;father’s mom three times in&nbsp;my&nbsp;life. That’s just how it&nbsp;was, and it&nbsp;wasn’t something&nbsp;I needed an&nbsp;explanation for. If, by&nbsp;some off chance, your child does ask, just be&nbsp;honest and tell him dad’s mom has some behavioral issues that led to&nbsp;you not feeling safe having him near her.<br>Let her stay gone. Seriously, she’s just throwing a&nbsp;tantrum to&nbsp;get you to&nbsp;chase her. It’s really not that deep. If&nbsp;she can’t follow one simple boundary, let her stay under her rock. Go&nbsp;on&nbsp;about your lives.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;jaefreeze88&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><ul><li>Which sounds better to&nbsp;you:<br>Explaining why you let this woman disrespect you and your child their whole lives when they’re teens or&nbsp;young adults, or&nbsp;explaining why you made certain they didn’t get to&nbsp;do&nbsp;that when they’re teens or&nbsp;young adults?<br>This is&nbsp;about a&nbsp;lot more than kissing a&nbsp;baby. This is&nbsp;about having the love and respect for your adult son to&nbsp;follow one simple rule instead of&nbsp;behaving like a&nbsp;toddler demanding your way and repeatedly trying to&nbsp;force your will on&nbsp;them. Learning to&nbsp;set and maintain boundaries yourself will be&nbsp;a&nbsp;great lesson for your child.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;RelativelyRidiculous&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><ul><li>Keep your evidence and keep your recording.<br>Not only it’s always good to&nbsp;keep the folder, but also in&nbsp;the off chance that they’ll go&nbsp;no&nbsp;contact with you for years only to&nbsp;reappear when the baby is&nbsp;old enough just to&nbsp;spin the narrative&nbsp;— “we’re your real family who loved and missed you so&nbsp;much, but your horrible parents kept you away from&nbsp;us”&nbsp;— you’ll have a&nbsp;proof that, in&nbsp;fact, they saw themselves out because they wouldn’t follow the safety precautions.<br>Good luck 🍀 <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;tatiyana_queenguin&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><ul><li>Why would you want to&nbsp;repair&nbsp;it? She said some awful things about you. And you have it&nbsp;on&nbsp;tape! She also said she never wants to&nbsp;see you again, so&nbsp;grant her wish there. She simply can’t be&nbsp;trusted, as&nbsp;she went nuclear over a&nbsp;simple, clear rule.<br>What do&nbsp;you say to&nbsp;the kids? Grandma wasn’t nice to&nbsp;us, and we&nbsp;don’t allow people who hurt&nbsp;us in&nbsp;our lives.
