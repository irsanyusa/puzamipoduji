Due to the judge’s romance life (which includes two former contestants), many are wondering if she’s fit to be included in the series in the coming year.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-should-jojo-siwa-judge-sytycd-in-2025>Should JoJo Siwa Judge SYTYCD in 2025?</h2><p>On August 14, Siwa (21) confirmed her relationship with 18 year old contestant, Dakayla Wilson. Additionally, the pair shared photos from Disney World over the weekend. This relationship comes after Siwa was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted kissing</a> other former contestant, Madison Alvarado, 21 years old. It was also <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">rumored</a> that Alvarado attended Nick Viall’s April wedding with Siwa.</p><p>Fans are excited for Siwa and her new flame, but are also questioning her spot on SYTYCD, given the circumstances. For those who may not know, Glee star <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Matthew Morrison</a> was axed from the judging panel in 2022 “after he had an inappropriate relationship with a female contestant.”</p><a title=@itsjojosiwa href=# rel=noopener>@itsjojosiwa</a><p>Girlfriend had no idea what she was walking out to</p><a title="♬ Yesterday's Tomorrow's Today - JoJo Siwa" href=# rel=noopener>♬ Yesterday's Tomorrow's Today – JoJo Siwa</a><p>“They didn’t have sex, but he reached out to her through flirty direct messages on social media,” the source <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shared</a> at the time. “She felt uncomfortable with his line of comments and went to producers, who then got Fox involved. He was fired after they did their own investigation.”</p><p>Sources also included that Morrison “never met up off-set” with the contestant and “it was just messages that crossed the line.”</p><p>Many fans are now saying that Morrison’s situation is similar to Siwa’s due to the romantic nature. That being said, there is no evidence that Siwa’s romantic relationships with Alvarado or Wilson began during filming. Ultimately, it depends when Siwa began seeing the contestants and whether or not the romantic relationship began on the SYTYCD set.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-find-this-relationship-inappropriate>Fans Find This Relationship Inappropriate</h2><p>Regardless of whether Siwa will be introduced back to the judging panel next season, fans have been open about how they feel about Siwa’s new relationship. Generally, people find the situation “weird.”</p><p>“Fine I’ll be the one to say it. No one thinks it’s a bit weird for Jojo Siwa to be dating a teenager that was a contestant on a show she was judging for?” a user wrote on X/Twitter.</p><p>“wdym jojo siwa is dating dakayla… wtfffff that’s some weird as fuck power dynamics,” another user wrote on X/Twitter.</p><p>For those who may not know, Siwa was announced as apart of the judging panel for the So You Think You Can Dance Season 17. At the time, Siwa was faced with hardship, due to her age. When given criticism she replied: “[I have] 18 Years of Dance Knowledge. 4 Major dance TV shows . I’ve hired over 1000 dancers. 16 Dance music videos. If you don’t like me that’s okay… but if you think I don’t know about dance ya just sound silly.”</p><p>On that panel, she sat alongside Stephen “tWitch” Boss and Matthew Morrison. Due to Morrison’s “inappropriate relationship with a contestant” he was axed from the panel, and replaced by Leah Remini.</p><p>Siwa was reportedly not supposed to return for season 18. The judging panel for Season 18 originally included show creator Nigel Lythgoe, Allison Holker, and Maksim Chmerkovskiy. Siwa ended up on the panel because Lythgoe left the panel after being accused of sexual assault.</p><p>At this moment, it’s unknown whether So You Think You Can Dance will be renewed for a 19th season on FOX. Do you think Siwa should be allowed to return to the show?
