My daughter was able to do her dialysis. We’re forever grateful,” wrote Nery Torres in Spanish on the sustainability nonprofit’s<a href=# rel=noopener> Facebook page</a>, on Sept. 19, just days after <a href=#>Hurricane Fiona</a> hit Puerto Rico as a Category 1 storm. It was one of countless comments from residents expressing gratitude for their solar panel installations providing a reliable, or in Torres’ family’s case, life saving energy supply in times of emergency.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Fiona cut power across the whole of Puerto Rico, leaving over 1.1 million residents without <a href=# rel=noopener>electricity</a> as of Tuesday, and over 760,000 without <a href=# rel=noopener>water</a>. The exception were homes that had functioning generators or solar panels on their roofs. And for many people like Torres, that’s thanks to efforts from local nonprofits like Casa Pueblo, which have been the driving force behind helping many on the island turn to solar.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Puerto Rico has long suffered from blackouts ever since Hurricane Maria upended its electricity grid. As solar power proves resilient in the face of this latest hurricane, community organizers, nonprofits, and environmental advocates are calling for a solar revolution in Puerto Rico—the clean energy will help them get off a polluting, unreliable fossil-fuelled grid, and better weather the impacts of climate change.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Hurricane Fiona is just one more example of the urgency needed to transition to an electrical system that’s resilient and provides people what they need, which is rooftop solar and storage,” says Cathy Kunkel, an energy program manager at San Juan-based sustainability nonprofit <a href=# rel=noopener>Cambio PR</a>. “Puerto Rico needs something that’s not going to go out every time a major storm hits, because we’re just getting more and more of them.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Hurricane Fiona comes exactly at the five-year anniversary of Hurricane Maria, one of the deadliest Puerto Rican natural disasters that lead to the largest blackout in U.S. history. Now years later, the island’s recovery remains incomplete. Only 21% of post-storm projects have been completed by the government, and more than 3,600 homes still had makeshift blue tarps as roofs going into the latest hurricane, according to the <a href=# rel=noopener>Associated Press</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The damage wrought by Fiona will likely worsen anger in Puerto Rico at that slow progress. Last year, authorities in the territory hired LUMA Energy, a joint venture by two U.S. and Canadian companies, to take charge of improvements to the electric grid. Puerto Rican residents and <a href=# rel=noopener>celebrities </a>have been protesting against the privatization for months, calling for an early termination of LUMA’s 15 year contract.<a href=# rel=noopener> Protesters say</a> LUMA has failed to stop regular power outages in Puerto Rico, and that they are paying <a href=# rel=noopener>far higher energy bills</a> than other U.S. citizens. LUMA has blamed both those problems on years of underinvestment and neglect by the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA), which managed electric infrastructure before the private company took over last year.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">There have been other efforts to transition the grid in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. Tesla CEO Elon Musk <a href=# rel=noopener>tweeted</a> in 2017 that he could rebuild Puerto Rico’s power grid with solar power technology. Tesla soon began <a href=# rel=noopener>distributing resources</a>, including sending solar panels and energy storage batteries to necessary hospitals. But the company’s push towards building clean energy microgrids suffered from “supply shortages, regulatory hurdles and a lack of long-term planning,” according to <a href=# rel=noopener>HuffPost</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Despite Tesla’s failed efforts, many continue to argue that switching to solar power is the strongest option moving forward. According to a <a href=# rel=noopener>study</a> by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, solar panels have just a 0.05% failure rate when it comes to reliability and lifespan. “The surest path to lowering rates and stabilizing the finances of the electrical system is to end Puerto Rico’s dependence on fossil fuels,” <a href=# rel=noopener>writes </a>Tom Sanzillo, the director of financial analysis for the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Puerto Rico is well placed for a transition to solar power. A preliminary <a href=# rel=noopener>study</a> from the National Lab of Renewable Energy’s PR100 program found that Puerto Rico could produce over four times the amount of energy it needs from rooftop solar power thanks to how much sunlight the island is exposed to. Already, Puerto Rico is <a href=# rel=noopener>among the top ten</a> places in the U.S. with the most home solar installation per-capita, coming in 9th ahead of Colorado (as well as Washington D.C., and New Jersey which sit just outside the top 10).</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Casa Pueblo, run by local community organizers, has been at the forefront of Puerto Rico’s solar transition. In the last few years, they have installed solar energy systems in over 100 hundred homes and over 30 businesses in the Adjuntas, a mountainous town in the center of the island. They’ve personally been operating their base on solar energy since 1999.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Ada Ramona Miranda has assisted the Casa Pueblo team with installing solar roofs for over 20 businesses so that they don’t have to rely on the expensive, fragile electrical grid. “I wanted to offer communities the possibility of enjoying sustainable and renewable energy,” Miranda explained in a <a href=# rel=noopener>Duolingo podcast episode</a> earlier this year. “Energy independence is essential for people if there is another emergency.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But the group is not alone in its efforts. Nonprofits like <a href=# rel=noopener>Solar Responders</a> have worked to install solar panels in fire stations on the island to ensure first responders are able to continue their work when the electric grid fails. They’ve helped install renewable energy in nearly 20% of the fire stations in Puerto Rico.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“When a storm comes and the power goes out, first responders are in saving mode. It’s not their role to figure out the power situation,” says Hunter Johansson, founder of Solar Responders. Johansson hopes to continue distributing solar power roofs and battery storage to the remaining 77 fire stations on the island, he says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But the push to go solar has largely been left to the hands of these nonprofits, or in many cases, individuals themselves, rather than the government. There are, on average, over 2,800 new monthly solar project installations to buildings in Puerto Rico, according to <a href=# rel=noopener>an August report</a> LUMA submitted to Puerto Rico’s Department of Energy. “The numbers speak for themselves and these are people doing it on their own,” says Sanzillo. “From an institutional point of view, this is a quintessential statement of market demand.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The demand to go solar is clear, but ensuring all communities have access to it remains a major concern. For Puerto Rican residents, going solar largely comes down to whether or not you can afford it. The average <a href=# rel=noopener>median household income</a> in Puerto Rico is just over $21,000. In San Juan, Puerto Rico’s capital, the average cost to install home solar is <a href=# rel=noopener>between $10,000 and $12,000.</a> That makes the upfront cost of solar out of reach for “the majority of the population who are left stuck with this very debilitated and poorly managed grid,” says Cambio PR’s Kunkel.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">To combat this environmental injustice and make solar accessible to everyone, money from Puerto Rico’s $13 billion post-Maria federal recovery aid needs to be allocated to create centralized and distributed solar energy, instead of centralized natural gas and diesel plants, says Sanzillo. Creating institutional incentives for low-income families like grants or federal tax credits could help, he adds.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">While PREPA and LUMA continue to prioritize natural gas, the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico and the Puerto Rico Energy Bureau, have <a href=# rel=noopener>pushed a plan</a> that positions renewable energy as an economical way to help balance their budget against Puerto Rico’s $70 billion public debt and reduce the more than $2 billion annual cost of importing fuel.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Going solar isn’t only more reliable, but more affordable,” says Sanzillo. “If they followed that plan, they would be delighted to see it as a real wind on their back.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the meantime, as people recover from the latest hurricane, Casa Pueblo continues to <a href=# rel=noopener>share updates</a> about how their solar-powered microgrids are holding up well against strong winds and flooding.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The morning of Sept. 20, with the slow recovery process just beginning, the Casa Pueblo team was getting ready to distribute over 2,000 solar lamps to their community after raising <a href=# rel=noopener>a blue and green flag</a> outside of their headquarters—a symbol of their “energy insurrection.” In Spanish, they wrote on Facebook: “We’re summoning the government to build energy security for all.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><i>—With reporting by Ciara Nugent.</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvamFqfnSEjqympZmiYr2ww8SrZKmtlafBsHnRopqoZZiqv7O1wpqlnmWWnryvrY4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-pale-blue-eye-ending-explained.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'The Pale Blue Eye' Ending Explained</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./reconnaissance-de-lexperience-professionnelle-comment-faire.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Reconnaissance de l'exprience professionnelle : comment faire ?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fontainebleau.html>Fontainebleau: Worlds Greatest Places 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-much-money-does-yung-joc-make-html.html>How Much Money Does Yung Joc Make?
