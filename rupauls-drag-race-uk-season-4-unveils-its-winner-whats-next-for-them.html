The series ended with an impressive faceoff between Cheddar Gorgeous and Danny Beard, ultimately hailing Danny Beard as the winner.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-danny-beard-is-drag-race-uk-season-four-winner>Danny Beard is Drag Race UK Season Four Winner</h2><p>The grand finale of <a href=#>Drag Race UK</a> season four was nothing short of amazing. Weeks of fascinating looks, emotional sashays, and fierce Untucks have led to four remaining queens to compete for the crown. They are Jombers Blonde, Black Peppa, Danny Beard and Cheddar Gorgeous.</p><p>Joining RuPaul in the judging panel were Michelle Visage, Alan Carr, and Graham Norton. Meanwhile, choreographer Claudimar Neto was assigned to assist the queens for their last challenge.</p><p>After the final challenge, Cheddar and Danny emerged as top two finalists. Both divas gave their all during the lip-sync, but Danny turned out victorious in the end.</p><p>For those who may have missed it, Danny—who uses they/them as pronouns—was first one to enter the Werk Room. Interestingly, they were the last to walk away in the competition as season four champion.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>They Auditioned Thrice, Competed Against Their Idols</h2><p>Opening about their Drag Race story, Danny Beard says they weren’t ashamed by the fact that they auditioned three times. They essentially see such experiences as an imperative to their success. As they fight for their rightful spot, they had to battle their idols, including Cheddar.</p><p>“A lot of drag queens get in their feelings about not being cast, but it’s not about how good or bad we are as drag queens, it’s whether they have the right people,” they said. “If I had got on when I first auditioned, I wouldn’t be sat here.”</p><p>At the outset of the competition, Danny Beard was already the one to watch in the series. They received their first RuPeter badge during week two, snatching three more as the competition went on. The Lairy Poppins Ru-sical episode was the point they become more determined to win.</p><p>“When everyone was so strong and I just managed to get the edge on everyone, it really lit a fire under me,” they said.</p><p>Obviously, Danny wasn’t always on top of the board throughout the competition. Nevertheless, it comforted them to know that there were really days where others would shine instead of them.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What’s Next for Danny Beard?</h2><p>Now that they have won the competition, Danny Beard looks forward to making a career in television. According to them, being a television presenter is what they have always wanted to do.</p><p>“I would love to host my own Friday or Saturday night television show,” they said. “Celebrity guests, maybe sketches with the celebrities. Think Saturday Night Live meets The Ruby Wax Show.”</p><p>Danny Beard is the second queen from Liverpool, England to win RuPaul’s Drag Race UK. The first one was The Vivienne who was crowned back in season one.</p><p>“The crown is a gorgeous rhinestone cherry on top, but I know the hard work is only just beginning,” they <a href=#>said</a>.</p><p>Last September, the show issued a casting call for the next series. However, BBC Three has not yet released final details about Drag Race UK season 5.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Original_NickCannon_MariahCarey_Rich-Polk_FilmMagic.jpg alt="Every Single One of Nick Cannon’s Kids’ Names" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>rupaul's drag race</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>rupaul's drag race uk</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570a6nmq2cqHqlvsCgZKuZk5p6treMrJyaq5%2BjenV51KetnqGcqHqqwNJmrqKmnpq%2FbsPHmqusZZ6axbV5xaipZqyYmrpw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./german-rock-bands.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The 5 greatest German rock bands of all time</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./les-maires-en-premiere-ligne-du-controle-de-linstruction-dans-les-familles.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Les maires en premire ligne du contrle de l'instruction dans les familles</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fontainebleau.html>Fontainebleau: Worlds Greatest Places 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-much-money-does-yung-joc-make-html.html>How Much Money Does Yung Joc Make?
