Cardholders earn an unlimited 4% cash back on dining and entertainment purchases, 2% at grocery stores, and 1% everywhere else. Plus, <a href=# id=f9cc571d-cb88-3290-ab6e-38a0a1bd91de>you'll earn 8% cash back on tickets at Vivid Seats</a> through May 2020. It doesn't matter if you are a single person looking for a night on the town, a family headed out for dinner, or empty nesters who enjoy the finer things in life, you can maximize your rewards with Savor.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><a href=# id=7c8734bc-569a-31bb-a5d6-6c842c756503>Savor</a> currently offers a $500 cash-back bonus after spending $3,000 in the first three months after opening a new account. It charges a $95 annual fee, which is waived the first year.</p><p>While <a href=# id=7c8734bc-569a-31bb-a5d6-6c842c756503>Savor</a> is padding your account with bonus category purchases, you should consider <a href=# id=88e02a12-0fe8-37a6-ae8c-35bbba79ca89>Capital One's Venture card</a> for your "everywhere else" purchases. Why? It offers 2x Venture Miles per dollar no matter where you spend. When you combine both cards, you'll earn at least 2x miles per dollar or 2% cash back on every purchase no matter what.</p><p><a href=# id=bf364735-be26-35c5-ae63-2b99bdd5d635>Venture</a> starts you with 50,000 bonus miles after spending $3,000 in the first three months and charges a $95 annual fee that's also waived the first year. Until January 2020, you can earn 10x miles per dollar on hotel reservations thanks to a partnership with Hotels.com/Venture.</p><p>Both cards are great on their own, but when you put them together, you'll earn more than you can with either card alone.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-15>How to use Venture and Savor to maximize your rewards</h3></p><p>If you are like me, you regularly spend at restaurants, grocery stores, gas stations, hardware stores, big-box retailers, and those oh-so-convenient online stores. If you use just <a href=# id=7c8734bc-569a-31bb-a5d6-6c842c756503>Savor</a> , you will only earn 1% cash back on more than half of those categories. But with food being so important, most people get a lot of value from the 4% back at restaurants and 2% at grocery stores.</p><p>It would be a shame to get just 1% cash back on "everything else" when you can get more. That's where <a href=# id=bf364735-be26-35c5-ae63-2b99bdd5d635>Venture</a> comes in. Grabbing the Venture card from your wallet for those purchases will have you on the way to free flights, hotels, and other travel in no time depending on your spending habits.</p><p>I carry five cards in my wallet every day and have to remember which one to use where. With just these two, all you have to remember is where the <a href=# id=7ef1c017-c7e3-3ab5-acee-8e7042049247>Savor card</a> offers a bonus. Outside of dining, entertainment, and grocery stores, that <a href=# id=47ed35ea-fb92-3ddc-a939-815db570688e>Venture card</a> would be your go-to.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-20>Picking just one for your wallet</h3></p><p>If you are averse to having two cards with $95 annual fees, I get it.</p><p>But before you say no, do the math on your most common spending categories. You might find that both cards pay for themselves multiple times over each year. The sign-up bonuses alone cover at least a few years of annual fees.</p><p>But if you really do just want one, consider where you spend the most and which rewards you most value.</p><p>If you love to travel, <a href=# id=bf364735-be26-35c5-ae63-2b99bdd5d635>Venture</a> is a top-ranking card that makes it really easy to use your miles. You can redeem miles as a statement credit to wipe travel charges off of your statement. That means no blackout dates or limitations to worry about. Just book travel and pay with your Venture card like any other purchase, then redeem to pay for it.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>If you don't like to travel regularly, prefer cash back, or spend very heavily in the dining and entertainment categories, you should go with the <a href=# id=7ef1c017-c7e3-3ab5-acee-8e7042049247>Savor card</a> . It's tough to beat an unlimited 4% on the dining category. Entertainment makes it even more lucrative. The 2% at the grocery store from Savor and 2x miles per dollar from Venture are roughly equal.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-28>Think every time you pay</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>So which card should you get? Consider both. But if you want just one, look at your spending patterns to pick the card that will give you the best rewards. After all, that's what rewards credit cards are all about!</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-31>Click here to learn more about the Capital One Venture from Insider Picks partner: The Points Guy</h3></p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-32>Click here to learn more about the Capital One Savor from Insider Picks partner: The Points Guy</h3></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p7xaKlmqaTmnykrc%2Biq5qkXaS7pnnVnqWtraKaere%2FjKyYr6eiYsK0tc2gZJunpJ16pL7EnaCtZZOWv6W%2FjK2moJ2knbKzecisZKKclZa5bq7UrWShnaKawG60zrBmb66krMa5vQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./fumio-kishida-approval-rating.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fumio Kishidas Approval Rating Nears All-Time Low</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./an-awesome-japanese-technique-to-make-your-eyes-look-younger-it-only-requires-one-minute-672160.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>AnAwesome Japanese Technique toMake Your Eyes Look Younger ItOnly Requires One Minute</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fontainebleau.html>Fontainebleau: Worlds Greatest Places 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-much-money-does-yung-joc-make-html.html>How Much Money Does Yung Joc Make?
