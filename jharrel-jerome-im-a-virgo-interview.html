But he’s a lot more than just his height: He’s a Virgo (which means he loves adventure), simultaneously naïve and wise, and he really, <i>really</i> loves bass.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Cootie is the heart of <a href=#><i>I’m a Virgo</i></a>, the absurdist comedy series from <i>Sorry to Bother You</i> creator Boots Riley, which comes out Friday on Prime Video. (Yes, Riley, a self-proclaimed communist, <a href=# rel=noopener>acknowledges</a> the irony of an anti-capitalist show streaming on Amazon, but he’s got to get his work out there somehow. As he <a href=# rel=noopener>told <i>Variety</i></a>, “There’s no clean way to get stuff done.”)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The 19-year-old giant has been sheltered his whole life by the aunt (Carmen Ejogo) and uncle (Mike Epps) who raised him, siloed from the outside world by their fear and protection. He learns about that world through a steady supply of TV shows and comic books—specifically those about The Hero, a.k.a. Jay Whittle (Walton Goggins), a tech billionaire and supposed superhero who believes that law equates to morality.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Enter: Felix (Brett Gray), Jones (Kara Young), and Scat (Allius Barnes), a group of friends from the neighborhood who take Cootie in and introduce him to the ways and wonders of the world outside his doors. After his first night out at a club, Cootie comes home incensed—how could his aunt and uncle have withheld the glory of the subwoofer? “I’m 19 and I heard bass for the first time?” he says. “That’s abuse!”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Cootie is brought to gangly, lovable life by Emmy winner Jharrel Jerome, who gave memorable performances in <a href=#><i>Moonlight</i></a> and <a href=#><i>When They See Us</i></a>, and lent his voice to Miles G. Morales in the recent hit <a href=#><i>Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse</i></a>. Riley reached out to him about the role via email: “13 foot tall Black man from Oakland. I want you as the lead.” The show, though shot through with surrealism, addresses real-world problems: economic inequality, the exploitation of the working class, and how to organize against it.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“With Cootie, Boots found a way to make, honestly, a larger-than-life Black man,” Jerome tells TIME, en route to Oakland for an advance screening. “I think as a Black man, when you walk around the street, you kind of already feel like Cootie: You feel a little too big, or you feel a little too intimidating, even though you’re pure-hearted. Maybe you’re just going to the grocery store to grab something for your grandmother,” he continues. “But an officer of the law or somebody of upper class might look at you like you’re 13 feet tall and you’re this monster.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Jerome spoke to TIME about inhabiting Cootie, working with Riley, and what he’ll take with him from the character.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This interview has been edited for concision and clarity.</p><p></p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>TIME: <i>I’m a Virgo</i></b><b> creates this rich sense of place in Oakland. The city clearly means a lot to Boots, the same way you’ve said the Bronx means so much to you. How did you honor that? How did you learn the culture?</b></h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Jerome: Yeah, I think Boots’ love for Oakland is definitely similar to my love for the Bronx. He is very inspired by the culture of Oakland music, Bay Area music, all the way from back when he was in The Coup in the ’90s. So for me, adopting Oakland style was very easy just hanging around him. But Cootie has been inside of his home his entire life. Early on in my process of dissecting the character, I realized that Cootie shouldn’t be inspired by Oakland itself, and more so inspired by his parents and The Hero and the comic books and TV shows that he’s been watching.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/VRGO_107_STILL-2RC_3000.jpg><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>Cootie has this inexplicable love for subwoofers and bass. As a musician, what did you make of that? What did you think of the kind of hyphy soundtrack?</b></h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">One of my favorite lines in the entire script is when Cootie goes on that monologue about how he feels like he was abused for not listening to bass. It’s just such a testament of Boots’ passion for both music and filmmaking. To see a musician put in a script in such beautiful detail the feeling of what it feels like to listen to bass is so important, and it goes exactly with who Boots Riley is as a person.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The music is incredible. <a href=# rel=noopener>Tune-Yards</a> work really well with Boots. Boots is big on these very wacky, existential sounds to push the feeling and the vision that he has, and Tune-Yards know exactly how to do that.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>You’ve picked some really powerful projects so far, including this one. What makes a role stand out to you?</b></h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I definitely have been purposely meticulous in this way. Pretty much how I see it is, if I’m 45 years old, I want to look back at <a href=# rel=noopener>my IMDb page</a> and be like, “This is back-to-back bangers.” And of course that’s not easy. But I love the idea of longevity over just doing it now for the sake of it. I’m very big on who I’m going to be surrounded by. So I’m patient in that regard. And then there’s just this feeling I get after I finish reading a script where I have butterflies in my stomach because I just want to be that character so bad. I don’t often feel that, so I trust my gut when I do.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/VRGO_S1_UT_105_220516_LEEPET_00342R_Crop_3000.jpg><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>The Hero says that “all art is propaganda.” How do you feel about that, given that art is your whole career?</b></h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I love that line, because I think that is the irony of the entire project. There’s a lot of ironic details with the release of the show. One just being such an anti-capitalistic piece being streamed on Amazon. And then Boots missing all the press because he is currently on strike, which is the essence of what this show is about, standing up and being a revolutionary. I agree with [that line]. I think as artists we’re aware of the propaganda that might be set, but I think it’s about changing the fine print.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>What do you mean by that, changing the fine print?</b></h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I think everything’s going to be at least viewed as propaganda, but what is the overall message we’re trying to push behind the propaganda? Propaganda might not be a negative word if we don’t want it to be. The idea of it is just pushing a message, right? So Boots is finding a way to write a show that’s almost anti-propaganda propaganda. There’s just a beauty in him even writing that line as an artist who’s dealing with that issue. So in my opinion, he’s changing the fine print a little bit.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>What do you think Boots was trying to convey politically through Cootie?</b></h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Boots has a way of—I don’t know how he does it—but he can fit 30 themes and concepts into one scene sometimes. I think depending on your age, your demographic, the neighborhood you live in, it will inform how you receive this show. And I think that’s the beauty of the show. Boots was able to write such a lovable, nuanced character that can really mirror the lives of a lot of Black people in America today, in just being different, between being an outcast, between being viewed as somebody different than who you really are.<b></b></p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>Cootie has such a sense of awkwardness and naiveté to him—how did you get that right?</b></h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The best word you said right there was naiveté. I wrote that word down a ton of times to keep myself centered. You have to toe the line between this wise, intelligent being and this socially awkward, unknowing person. He was really well-read. He’s smart. It’s just when it comes to the outside world that he has no idea what he’s doing. I pulled a lot from my personal experiences. Definitely not 13 feet tall, but I do relate to him in the sense of feeling young and old at the same time. I feel as though a lot of things around me forced me to be mature and a lot older than I feel. But then the little boy inside me is still on the swings at the playground.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/VRGO_104_STILL-1_v2RC_3000.jpg><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>In your </b><a href=# rel=noopener><b>interview</b></a><b> with </b><b><i>Emmy Magazine</i></b><b>, Boots said that “if we’re doing it right, we’re always coming of age.” How did Cootie fit into your own coming of age? What did he teach you?</b></h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I think that being strong behind your word is such a powerful characteristic to have. And you can see it’s allowed Cootie to survive in a lot of situations that he was thrown in. Even though he was the awkward one, he really firmly believed that he belonged there. I love to carry that with me wherever I go.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But Cootie has a million things to learn. It’s cool to play a character who doesn’t know much. It makes you rediscover things again. Even the line about bass, to explain bass in that way, and realize that’s exactly how I also feel about bass is such a beautiful thing. And that’s me coming of age right there in that moment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvamhuhXd%2FjqOfmqqimrlutsSrpqadXZ66bq2Mr6Crn59itq%2FAxKutop2nZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./seuil-de-15000-euros-pour-les-deputes-un-decret-cest-bien-une-loi-cest-mieux.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>pour les dputs, un dcret c'est bien, une loi c'est mieux</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-money-does-irina-shayk-make-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Much Money Does Irina Shayk Make?
