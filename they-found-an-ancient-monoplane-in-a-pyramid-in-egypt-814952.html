This place not far away from Cairo is&nbsp;full of&nbsp;ancient tombs and pyramids. You’re in&nbsp;your Indiana Jones mood and hope to&nbsp;find something really phenomenal and become famous. Gold, manuscripts, treasure maps, mummies of&nbsp;famous pharaohs... wait, a&nbsp;wooden bird? You’re really disappointed as&nbsp;it&nbsp;looks like a&nbsp;regular toy. An&nbsp;old one, but still. Little do&nbsp;you know that years later, someone would propose that your bird was actually an&nbsp;ancient monoplane.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/4a1/8b9/fb64e25e82bfd4b0503d901d20.png><p>So, the artifact, nicknamed the Saqqara Bird, is&nbsp;made of&nbsp;sycamore tree. The birdie has a&nbsp;wingspan of&nbsp;just 7&nbsp;inches and weighs around 40&nbsp;grams&nbsp;— a&nbsp;perfect original souvenir from Egypt, I&nbsp;would say. It’s over 2,000 years old and looks pretty plain, without any carvings of&nbsp;feathers or&nbsp;other intricate ornaments. It&nbsp;has a&nbsp;beak and eyes, though, which makes our find look like a&nbsp;hawk&nbsp;— the emblem of&nbsp;the deity Horus. Its tail is&nbsp;rather unusual as&nbsp;it’s squared, looks weirdly upright, and it&nbsp;seems like the sunken part of&nbsp;it&nbsp;was the place for a&nbsp;now missing piece.</p><p>Humans love solving a&nbsp;good mystery, so&nbsp;there have been several attempts to&nbsp;explain the use of&nbsp;the birdie. First, quite simply, is&nbsp;that it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;ceremonial object. The second idea is&nbsp;that it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;toy for a&nbsp;child from some well-off family. It&nbsp;could have been a&nbsp;sort of&nbsp;boomerang, which was a&nbsp;popular concept in&nbsp;Ancient Egypt. Then, there was a&nbsp;theory that the bird had been used as&nbsp;a&nbsp;weather vane. But this one has been debunked as&nbsp;the figure doesn’t have any holes or&nbsp;markings, except for the one made at&nbsp;the museum in&nbsp;Cairo to&nbsp;fix the exhibit on&nbsp;a&nbsp;stick. So&nbsp;there was no&nbsp;way to&nbsp;hang it&nbsp;in&nbsp;the past.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/57c/f23/7f511558c0a607f1d8e0b96e1f.png><p>Almost a&nbsp;century after the bird was found, Egyptologist Dr. Khalil Messiha proposed a&nbsp;new theory that it&nbsp;could have been a&nbsp;model of&nbsp;a&nbsp;monoplane. He&nbsp;believed the bird was missing a&nbsp;horizontal tailplane. Otherwise, it&nbsp;had its wings set at&nbsp;a&nbsp;right angle, similar to&nbsp;that of&nbsp;modern planes. It&nbsp;could have worked to&nbsp;generate the aerodynamic lift necessary for flights. Dr. Messiha also claimed that it&nbsp;was common at&nbsp;that time to&nbsp;place miniature models of&nbsp;technological inventions in&nbsp;tombs.</p><p>So, did the ancient Egyptians really invent the plane in&nbsp;200&nbsp;BCE? That would make the Wright Brothers, who are considered the inventors of&nbsp;aviation, really, really upset. They made one of&nbsp;their first flights only in&nbsp;1903. There’s just one way to&nbsp;know for sure, and that is&nbsp;to&nbsp;test the model. But you know, the Egyptian Museum in&nbsp;Cairo would unlikely let one of&nbsp;their cherished exhibits fly around like a&nbsp;toy. That’s why glider designer Martin Gregorie built a&nbsp;similar model, this time of&nbsp;balsa wood, and concluded that even with the missing tailplane, the plane wasn’t much of&nbsp;a&nbsp;flier.</p><p>Case solved? Not really! This didn’t sound convincing enough to&nbsp;the History Channel, so&nbsp;they invited an&nbsp;aerodynamics expert to&nbsp;build another replica of&nbsp;the bird. He&nbsp;tested it&nbsp;in&nbsp;weather conditions similar to&nbsp;those in&nbsp;Egypt and was impressed with the little plane’s abilities. So, if&nbsp;they did invent the prototype of&nbsp;a&nbsp;plane back in&nbsp;the times of&nbsp;pharaohs, it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;a&nbsp;good example of&nbsp;an&nbsp;Oopart. That’s an&nbsp;out-of-place artifact, an&nbsp;object that’s way ahead of&nbsp;its time in&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;technology or&nbsp;history. And the Saqqara Bird isn’t the only example of&nbsp;such a&nbsp;revolutionary concept.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/077/0c1/eadd1c54d998c119875d0e0386.png><p>In&nbsp;1901, a&nbsp;group of&nbsp;divers retrieved the Antikythera mechanism from an&nbsp;underwater shipwreck near the Greek island of&nbsp;Antikythera. It’s been dubbed “the world’s first analog computer,” and it’s currently dated around 100&nbsp;BCE. The bronze mechanism could tell the positions of&nbsp;the Sun, Moon, planets, and stars, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;the lunar phase, the dates of&nbsp;upcoming solar eclipses, and even the speed at&nbsp;which the Moon moves through the sky. No&nbsp;one is&nbsp;sure who used it&nbsp;and how or&nbsp;where it&nbsp;was made. But it’s obvious that it&nbsp;is&nbsp;extremely precise and way too advanced for its time.</p><p>The first flushing toilets in&nbsp;the world were invented in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;the 20th century. Just kidding! The ancient Minoans on&nbsp;the Mediterranean island of&nbsp;Crete and the Indus Valley Civilization both came up&nbsp;with this brilliant invention at&nbsp;the same time, around 4,000 years ago. The plumbing and sanitation were so&nbsp;well-done that no&nbsp;one managed to&nbsp;design anything better until two thousand years later. One ancient Minoan lavatory was discovered at&nbsp;the palace of&nbsp;Knossos. It&nbsp;looks like it&nbsp;had a&nbsp;wooden seat set over a&nbsp;tunnel that directed water from a&nbsp;rooftop reservoir to&nbsp;an&nbsp;underground sewer. Other varieties got water from jugs. Only the super-rich people could afford all this glory. So&nbsp;if&nbsp;you wanted to&nbsp;shop for real estate back then, the flushing toilet would be&nbsp;a&nbsp;tell-tale sign you were in&nbsp;the rich neighborhood.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/130/115/15652c5089907aa3663cb7af4a.png><p>Automated doors became a&nbsp;cool, seemingly new invention back in&nbsp;1931, but the technology behind them is&nbsp;actually much older&nbsp;— think the 1st century&nbsp;CE old. Mathematician and engineer Heron of&nbsp;Alexandria came up&nbsp;with a&nbsp;hydraulic system to&nbsp;open and close temple doors. To&nbsp;bring it&nbsp;into action, you’d need to&nbsp;light a&nbsp;fire to&nbsp;produce heat. There was a&nbsp;brass pot under the fire, half filled with water. The inventor connected the brass pot to&nbsp;containers that acted as&nbsp;weights. When the fire was burning, the water moved into the containers. They went down and pulled the ropes. It&nbsp;was nothing like a&nbsp;supermarket door that opens in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;you before you even have time to&nbsp;think. Heron’s door took hours to&nbsp;open, and there was no&nbsp;way to&nbsp;stop the process. That’s why they only opened the doors once a&nbsp;day before people entered the temple to&nbsp;add some mysticism at&nbsp;the temple during ceremonies. Spooky!</p><p>Looks like the first-ever <a href=# title=battery data-link=tag>battery</a> was invented in&nbsp;Baghdad around 2,000 years ago. A&nbsp;German archeologist found this oval-shaped clay jar in&nbsp;1938. Scientists are still not sure what purposes it&nbsp;served and who exactly invented&nbsp;it. There is&nbsp;a&nbsp;theory that it&nbsp;was used for electroplating objects with precious metals. When they filled it&nbsp;with a&nbsp;weak acid, like vinegar, the battery produced around 1&nbsp;volt of&nbsp;electricity. Another theory says it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;vessel for sacred scrolls.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/d5a/53c/1f1d815ccbb0f7442d2928fa03.png><p>Would you like to&nbsp;buy contact lenses designed by&nbsp;Leonardo da&nbsp;Vinci himself? In&nbsp;1508, he&nbsp;invented a&nbsp;glass lens with a&nbsp;funnel on&nbsp;one side. You were supposed to&nbsp;wear it&nbsp;and our water inside to&nbsp;improve your vision. Sounds a&nbsp;bit... uncomfortable, doesn’t it? So, around a&nbsp;century later, French scientist René Descartes decided to&nbsp;improve the idea and make the cornea contact the future lenses. “Contacts” because they “contact” your eyes&nbsp;— get&nbsp;it? The glass tube filled with liquid did help improve vision, but blinking was sadly impossible.</p><p>2,5 centuries later, new technologies in&nbsp;the glass industry let scientists design contacts that would fit in&nbsp;the eye and even let the wearer blink&nbsp;— thanks, guys! Still, those lenses were made of&nbsp;heavy-blown glass and didn’t let the eye breathe. About 50&nbsp;years later, contacts became plastic, lightweight, unbreakable, and scratch-resistant, but still covering the entire eye. And then, in&nbsp;1948, an&nbsp;English optical technician accidentally sanded down a&nbsp;plastic lens and figured out they’d still be&nbsp;in&nbsp;place even if&nbsp;they covered only the cornea.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/51a/234/ad02cc55e1a77f35ca4a27976b.png><p>Imagine you’re living in&nbsp;19th-century London and need to&nbsp;send a&nbsp;message to&nbsp;New York. It&nbsp;would have taken it&nbsp;about 10&nbsp;days to&nbsp;get there by&nbsp;ship. So&nbsp;when delivery time went from days to&nbsp;hours in&nbsp;1858, it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;true sensation. The first message was sent by&nbsp;Queen Victoria herself. It&nbsp;was all made possible thanks to&nbsp;a&nbsp;Transatlantic telegraph cable running under the ocean. Sadly, the new cool invention only lasted a&nbsp;few weeks. It&nbsp;took years to&nbsp;bring it&nbsp;back to&nbsp;life.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGpsdhmnaitnpl6orqMmqWcoZWjwW65zqemqaSRo7Jutc1mmGaoqaeurrXDZqCnZZWcxrHAjHFobXFlZ3w%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bella-thorne-is-completely-unbothered-by-ex-tana-mongeau-talking-about-her-on-tiktok.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bella Thorne is Completely Unbothered By Ex Tana Mongeau Talking About Her on TikTok</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./subjunctive-vs-indicative-in-french-what-are-the-differences.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Subjunctive vs indicative in French</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fontainebleau.html>Fontainebleau: Worlds Greatest Places 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-much-money-does-yung-joc-make-html.html>How Much Money Does Yung Joc Make?
