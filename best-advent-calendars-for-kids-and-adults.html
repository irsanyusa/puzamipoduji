For example, some small gifts hidden inside an Advent calendar may be choking hazards for a toddler or young child. If you want to give an Advent calendar to a traditionalist, maybe stick with a paper calendar with the Nativity or a Christmas tree they can hang on their wall or prop up on their mantel. If you are giving a candy-filled calendar, check for allergies beforehand. Some Advent calendars are designed to stand independently, while others must be hung up or leaned against a wall, bookcase or mantel. Consider that the person opening the calendar will likely enjoy it as a piece of decor and a vessel for small holiday gifts.</p><h3>Does it have 12 or 24 days?</h3><p>The season of Advent usually starts four weeks before Christmas. The first Sunday (the start of the Advent season) always starts the fourth Sunday before Christmas. Because of this, the starting date for Advent may shift from year to year, but Advent calendars always start on the first day of December. The Advent calendar's last door is traditionally opened on December 24, the day before Christmas. However, some Advent calendars have only 12 days due to the nature of the products packed inside. If you love a 12-day calendar but want to celebrate 24 days, consider buying two calendars to carry you through the season.</p><h3>Is it easy to open?</h3><p>While this is not a make-or-break issue for purchasing an Advent calendar, if you have children, make sure they can easily open the Advent calendar window or door. Otherwise, you will have torn calendars, which really defeats the purpose of using them as decor. Some Advent calendars, like those made of wood, are easier for little hands to open than the more fragile paper and cardboard ones.How we selected the best advent calendars</p><p>Advent calendars are a personal choice based on individual and family preferences, and have been a part of my family and my husband’s family for generations. To select the best Advent calendars, I drew on our experiences and those of our friends, extended family members and colleagues. In addition, I researched nearly 100 (yes, there are really that many Advent calendars out there) calendars to make this list, reading reviews and looking carefully at price points, gifts, longevity, decorative materials and more.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>How do advent calendars work?</h3><p>Advent calendars are numbered from 1-24, representing the days leading up to Christmas. Advent calendars are made so you can open one “door” or “window” or, in some cases, as calendars have evolved, one drawer, cabinet or pocket a day. When you open it, there is a small gift, sweet note, holiday image or miniature treasure. Often, Advent calendars are designed to be displayed in the home as a Christmas decoration.</p><p>Advent calendars have become so popular, you can find Advent-style calendars for holidays like <a rel=alternate href=#>Halloween</a> and Hanukkah.</p><h3>What is the reason for an Advent calendar?</h3><p>Traditionally Advent calendars build anticipation and excitement as you count the days of Advent leading up to Christmas. But anyone can enjoy an Advent calendar simply to mark the days in December.</p><p>Most Advent calendars are used as celebratory traditions to give tiny gifts or sweets and help extend the holiday season's celebration for most of December.</p><h3>When should I gift my Advent calendar?</h3><p>I like to give my children their Advent calendars right after Thanksgiving. Still, you can gift an Advent calendar any time of year—the recipient just has to be willing to save it until December 1, when they can start opening an Advent calendar. You could also give an Advent calendar on the first Sunday (of four) in Advent, typically between November 27 and December 3). This year, Advent begins on December 3.</p><h3>Why is Advent so important to Christmas?</h3><p>The word “Advent” is derived from the Latin word “adventus”, meaning “arrival (ad)” and “venire (come).” It means the arrival of an important person or thing. Many Christians celebrate the season of Advent (the four Sundays before Christmas) as a time of preparing for the nativity and anticipating the celebration of the birth of Jesus on Christmas Day.</p><p>Advent and the commercial culture surrounding Christmas were originally (and for some still) two different things that have merged into mainstream celebrations. The Advent wreath, candles and calendars are all ways Advent is celebrated at Christmas time in December.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lkZnDprrTZpqapJWjsaK%2B0madqKpdoLalv4yapZ1lkZnCrcDSaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dolly-alderton-bbc-everything-i-know-about-love-first-images-1235205491.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dolly Aldertons Everything I Know About Love: First Images of BBC Series Revealed</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-our-favorite-hollywood-celebrities-looked-like-before-they-got-famous-799321.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What Our Favorite Hollywood Celebrities Looked Like Before They Got Famous</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fontainebleau.html>Fontainebleau: Worlds Greatest Places 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-much-money-does-yung-joc-make-html.html>How Much Money Does Yung Joc Make?
