The actor was born in Schenectady, New York, on September 16 1952. He is 69 years old as of 2022, a few months shy of his 70th birthday. His father, Philip, worked as an amateur bodybuilder. In 1958, Philip left the family, and their mother, Annette, relocated with the three children. The family relocated to Miami, where Annette remarried.</p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION</strong>: Follow us on <a href=# title="Instagram Legit" rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a> - get the most important news directly in your favourite app!</p><h3>Mickey Rourke's rise to fame</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/203cbbbab7efe68a.png><p class=align-left>When the family relocated to Miami, the young Mickey Rourke had to come up with coping mechanisms and ways of surviving. His stepfather was abusive, so he had to carve his own life.</p><p class=align-left>He was particularly interested in sports, so he got training in self-defence as well as amateur boxing. He won his first boxing match at only 12 years old, and this motivated him to train hard at the 5th Street Gym, Miami Beach.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/aa84deca1d0178c2.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Eduardo Minett’s biography: age, height, net worth, movies</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Young Mickey played against the likes of Nino Benvenuto and Luis Rodriguez, but a concussion in 1971 made him take a year off from the game to rest, as advised by doctors. When he was in his final year at Miami Beach Senior High School, he had a cameo role in the school's play, The Serpent.</p><p class=align-left>Later, one friend from the University of Miami challenged him to audition for the leading role in the play, Deathwatch. When Rourke got the part, he asked his sister to lend him $400, which he used to relocate to New York.</p><p class=align-left>He enrolled for acting classes by Sandra Seacat and Water Lott. Young Mickey Rourke was featured in many Off-Broadway plays, and he enjoyed acting.</p><p class=align-left>With Mickey Rourke's boxing career seemingly over, he invested plenty of time and hours in acting classes. He got cameo roles in different television movies in the mid-1970s. At the time, he struggled financially, but this did not kill his morale.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/470e802ad97ea900.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Saga’s biography BBNaija: age, real name, father, state of origin</span></p></a><p class=align-left>He discovered that Christopher Walken did his eye makeup for his <a href=#>acting roles</a>, so Mickey also bought a makeup kit and insisted on doing his eyes without any assistance. He went to 78 auditions before getting his breakthrough.</p><p class=align-left>In 1981, the young actor had his much-awaited breakthrough in the industry when he was named part of the cast for the film <i>Body Heat.</i> This marked the beginning of his rise to fame, with numerous high-profile roles following.</p><h3>The fall from grace</h3><p class=align-left>Throughout the 1980s, Rourke continued establishing himself as an actor. His fan base increased drastically. His portrayal of Henry Chinaski, an alcoholic writer, in the movie <i>Barfly </i>earned him critical praise. However, his role on <i>Wild Orchid</i> in 1990 would change things. Many people criticized his role as James Wheeler in the film. During this period, he turned down offers to feature on popular shows such as <i>Top Gun, Beverly Hills Cop</i> and <i>Rain Man.</i></p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/34e25b2616d74026.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Lane Factor’s biography: age, height, birthday, tribe, movies</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Instead, he featured in the films<i> Harley Davidson</i> and the <i>Marlboro Man.</i> His <a href=#>acting career</a> was on a downward spiral at this point. He later starred in the movie White Sands, but most reviewers were heavily critical of his part.</p><p class=align-left>Around this time, fame and money had led the renowned actor to change his character. While he was a talented actor, his decisions on personal endeavours and career made him allegedly unbearable to work with. Directors reported that he was challenging to work with, and it was hard to tell what he would do next on the set. He later admitted that he was on a self-destructing path.</p><h3>Mickey Rourke's accident</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/73009c3b8d015132.jpg><p class=align-left>When his acting career had seemingly hit a dead-end, Rourke went back to his first love, boxing. He was aware that the decision was possibly detrimental to his health because he had already been injured in the ring before. He reported that he wanted to test his ability for the second time before it was too late.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4c60105ec9b75c39.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jeremy T.

He sustained numerous injuries, more severe than he had the first time. Rourke suffered from a few broken ribs, a compressed cheekbone, and a split tongue. He also suffered temporary memory loss. As a result of the injuries, he underwent reconstructive surgery on the face and retired from boxing again in 1994.</p><h3>What happened to Mickey Rourke's face?</h3><p class=align-left>Rourke had to have his face reconstructed after suffering injuries in the boxing ring. However, he reported that he went to the wrong surgeon for the job, so the outcome was not what he had hoped. As a result, he has had to undergo more surgeries to enhance and correct his appearance. Dr Griffin, his surgeon, admitted that <a href=#>the actor</a> needed to undergo surgery because he was experiencing breathing difficulties.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/80e2bcbcecb02714.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Hitman Holla’s biography: age, height, real name, girlfriend</span></p></a><p class=align-left>As of 2017, the actor and former boxer had had five nose jobs. He had also had one surgery to reconstruct his cheekbone. Cartilage from his ears was used to rebuild his nose. However, post-surgery recovery was difficult because the scar tissue failed to heal properly. As a result, he had to undergo another surgery to remove the cartilage.</p><h3>Making his acting comeback</h3><p class=align-left>After his failed acting and boxing careers, Rourke did not give up. He went back to Hollywood and landed small roles in a few films. Rourke's significant comeback role was in 2005 when he got the leading role of Marv in <i>Sin City</i>. He portrayed this character so well, earning praise from viewers and critics.</p><p class=align-left>For a moment, he had seemingly recovered from the years he had lost. For his performance, he earned Total Film Magazine's Man of the Year honour. He was back, now stronger than ever. His comeback story did not end with <i>Sin City.</i> In 2008, he was cast as Randy' The Ram' Robinson in <i>The Wrestler.</i></p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a63a8c1db312c35a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Brandon Flynn’s biography: age, height, sexuality, relationships</span></p></a><p class=align-left>After <i>The Wrestler</i> was released, it took the <a href=#>world</a> by storm.
