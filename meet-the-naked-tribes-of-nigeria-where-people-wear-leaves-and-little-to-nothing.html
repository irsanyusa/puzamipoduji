Hidden away in these hills, they move around freely naked or near-naked in leaves and loincloths. They cook with fire made with flint.</p><p>Majority of the Koma hill-dwellers depend on farming, hunting and gathering forest products like bananas, locust beans and canarium used for body lubrication. They buy farming implements and scarce items of clothing used by men on ceremonial occasions from the Fulani, Bata, Chamba and other tribes in the lowlands.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Once boys and girls turn about 14 and 17, both sexes undergo puberty rituals ( circumcision for boys and extraction of two of the incisors for girls). They are then free to interact before making their conjugal intentions known to their parents with reciprocal token gifts, a farm or garden plot works. If permitted, the man pays bride price with goats, chickens and some token cash of about two Naira.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-c85c7bb6-9ac1-4e8c-8cb9-00cbe9b5b8d9 data-caption="Koma people are one of the last naked tribes in Nigeria (tkbeshmagazine)"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/suSktkpTURBXy83Y2Y0NTIyYjRkZWUzMWE4YmMzMDVlYWJhYTVlMzU4NC5qcGeRlQLNAoDNAazCww></span><p>The Koma people believe in a supreme being called <strong>Zum</strong> or <strong>Nu</strong>.

After all, we have been managing ourselves well for over 60 years. Currently, we are about 500 men and women along with about 150 children. We are on our own. We believe strongly in our customs and traditions and we don’t need any religion or government to come here and change us."</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-40c21066-0b5a-41b0-9775-c75901aa3ece data-caption="A Kambari tribe girl [imgrum]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/HX4ktkpTURBXy82MTJlNjVmNmVlNDBiMzVmNDQ0ZjgyZGQ4YTkzOGQ3Yi5qcGeRlQLNAeDNAeDCww></span><p>“Since the god of our land, Migaro, is protecting us and taking care of all of us, we lack nothing. The borehole water we drink today is our personal effort. We even have a generator to charge our mobile phones. We have a rice mill and one of our people even has about 300 cows. So, you see, we lack nothing.”</p><p>They practice nudity as a major part of their culture. They only cover the bottom half of their bodies with wrappers when they have to go sell their farm produce (corn, millet, peanuts, beans, and rice) at the market.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-ba5b0def-ecfc-45d8-a2a5-f3dacf36c1aa data-caption="Nigeria's naked tribe of Kambari in Niger state [Punch Newspaper]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/b8EktkpTURBXy8wNjBjMmFmNDJiZjk5MmNmNjE1ZjkwMTBiY2QyY2E4Ny5qcGeRlQLNAcnM-8LD></span><p>“Moving around naked or half-naked is our culture and we don’t care what people say about us,” the Maiunguwa said. “We are comfortable that way because we find it normal. What attracts men is not nudity. Our men are attracted by how women plait their hair, good manners and the tattoos the young ladies have. Western civilisation is another man’s culture. Why must we embrace it, leaving our own that was handed over to us by our forefathers?”</p><p>They use donkeys as their only means of transport. This remote community do not speak English or Hausa, they speak their native language — Kambari instead.</p><p>Kambari men traditionally marry up to four wives and they have to ensure that their wives are well taken care of equally. Once a spouse is chosen, the parents of the bride slaughter goats and cows and cook for the groom. Most people keep chickens and goats while the richer ones have cattle. The marriage becomes official as soon as the food is eaten. Apart from worshipping their god, the Kambari people also believe in witchcraft and magic.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-4cdeb30d-fd8f-4e9f-bf1b-062489acdd54 data-caption="The kambari people receiving clothes [Linda Ikeji's Blog]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/7HfktkpTURBXy9mNWQ1M2UyM2ViYTJlNzdjYjBmODdkNjUxMGRlMjQwZS5qcGeRlQLNAtDNAhzCww></span><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-25>Jibu</h2></p><p>They were discovered by a Nigerian journalist name<strong>d Stephen Osu</strong>.
