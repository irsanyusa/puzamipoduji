It turned out to be a grand plug for California wine, not the wines of America, or even the U.S. In your rapture about the California product you make only a passing reference to the wines of New York. Also, why the omission of Ohio?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">J.K.

You overlooked the only major winery owned and operated by its grower members—over 800 of them, with more grape acreage under their control than any other single producer. You also overlooked the fact that our Winemaster’s Pinot Noir won the coveted Grand Prize for the most outstanding wine at the 1971 Los Angeles County Fair.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">ROBERT M.

But how and why did you omit the name of the one Californian who knows more about wine than anybody else in the world, who was and is responsible for the high quality of wine in America, and to whom people come to study from all other continents? I am speaking of course of Maynard Amerine of the University of California at Davis.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">One does not mind that a couple of the best vineyards were overlooked, but one wonders how Amerine, of all people, could possibly be omitted.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">BURGESS MEREDITH</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Malibu, Calif.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Shenanigans in the Navy</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sir / Apropos the shenanigans aboard the U.S.S.

The admirals who oppose him are the same as the ones who wept when Mitchell’s planes dropped dummy bombs on their battle wagons, the same as the ones who lined up the battle wagons at Pearl Harbor to scare the Japanese. They have always been guided by rigid stupidity. I don’t believe the conflict is basically racial. It was the same in World War II with no blacks.

We are among the majority of Indians who hold jobs and try to earn a living like other productive members of this great American society. How come we never make the headlines? How come we are not “pacified” with “expense money”? Someone must be crazy or have an awful lot to hide when these idiots are paid for destruction. We are trying to do something constructive with our lives and to teach our Indian children to buy the American way of life.

During my years as an undergraduate I’ve observed the rather blatant phenomenon that black and white college students still prefer to socialize separately. So where does the liberal go from here? Would he like to require that every black student room with a white, and that interracial roommates occupy every fifth dormitory space? Would he make it mandatory for a white student to spend every third date with a black? The good old American liberal just doesn’t give up, and he won’t be satisfied until all Americans live the way he thinks they should, like the things he says to like and think the thoughts he wants them to think.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">CHRISTOPHER BIRD</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Willimantic, Conn.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sir / I was a white civil rights worker back in 1965 when Stokely Carmichael and all the other black leaders wanted integration. None of us could believe that it wasn’t the only answer.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I spent time in jail while working in the South. I suffered permanently debilitating injuries in a car accident when I was riding in a SNCC car being shot at by the K.K..K. A few years later I was not allowed inside an auditorium where Carmichael and others were speaking. I do not blame the blacks one bit. When the young blacks were ready to “overcome,” too few whites, even among college students, were ready to join them. Now I see that most white students are ready, but it’s too late. We have no one to blame but ourselves.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">MARIA GITIN</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Madison, Wis.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sir / After I read your article “The Two Societies,” I had a mixed reaction. Having attended a college where the enrollment was predominantly white, I know well the feeling one gets when he is an object of curiosity, or when he is patronized excessively by some white students who feel he needs special help, or when he is subjected to outright hatred.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">To advocate and practice separatism, black or white, is to sustain ignorance and fear. Whites still have much to learn about blacks, but if we build walls around ourselves, we may expect the continuation of myths, fears and superstitions.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">JEFF JEFFERSON</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Asheville.N.C.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sir / Perhaps TIME should not accept so readily what college administrators state. In your article “The Two Societies,” Harvard was listed as having little separatism on campus. Not only is there a black theater group and a black choir here, but there are also black tables in the dining rooms. At least three-quarters of the 60 blacks who live in my dorm of 400 are in all-black roommate groups, and this is representative of all of the nonfreshman dormitories.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The article implied that this segregation was caused by a false view of the world among the black students and by their lack of preparedness for academic life. Most of the blacks here are not poor, and few are unprepared for college, but still the majority practices some kind of separatism.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">LOUISE A.
