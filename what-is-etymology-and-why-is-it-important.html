Their spelling and pronunciation morph and change, but they’re usually still recognizable as their younger selves. Sometimes, they get so old they stop traveling and drop off the map. Sometimes, they’re bold and they jump from one linguistic family to another. The history and journey of words is pretty fascinating, so read on to find out more about etymology in&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">English</a>, the study of the origin of words.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Ready to start learning with Lingoda?</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=What-is-etymology?>What is etymology?</h2><p>Ever wondered why some languages have a lot of words in common? Etymology can tell you why. Etymology is the study of the history of words, or the study of word origins. It traces a word from its earliest beginnings to where it is now and looks at all the places it stopped in between.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Etymology-in-the-English-language>Etymology in the English language</h2><p>A lot of English words come from&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Latin</a></strong>, often via French. Similar words can be found in other Latin-based languages like Italian and Romanian. Many other English words come from Germanic languages, and similar words appear in languages like Dutch and German.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>How can etymology help me?</h3><p>Etymology can help you understand your native language better. It can also teach you about the common root of words in several languages. That often means that you can recognize words in other languages without being told exactly what they mean.&nbsp;</p><p>Take the word ‘robot’ which comes from the Czech word&nbsp;robotnik&nbsp;meaning ‘laborer’. You can see variations of the word&nbsp;robotnik&nbsp;in lots of other Slavic languages meaning ‘worker’ or ‘manual laborer’, as well as the word&nbsp;robota, meaning ‘work’. Learning the root of one word allows you to understand words in a host of different languages. Etymology can help you take some shortcuts in language learning and who doesn’t want that?&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Ready to start learning with Lingoda?</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=8-English-words-with-an-interesting-etymology>8 English words with an interesting etymology</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. Dungarees</h3><p>The word ‘dungarees’ comes from the Hindi word&nbsp;dungri. The meaning of&nbsp;dungri&nbsp;is ‘coarse calico’ (the material dungarees were originally made of) and it comes from the village of Dungri, which was just outside Mumbai, and was where dungarees were originally made.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. Whiskey</h3><p>The origin of the word ‘whiskey’ is, not surprisingly, Gaelic, a language used in&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ireland</a></strong>&nbsp;and Scotland.&nbsp;Uisge beatha&nbsp;or&nbsp;usquebaugh&nbsp;is the Gaelic word for whiskey and it was corrupted into English as ‘whiskey’. It translates as ‘water of life’, which is fitting for when you’re drinking it but maybe not so much for the day after.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. Clue</h3><p>This word is a different spelling of the Germanic word&nbsp;clew&nbsp;which means a ball of thread or yarn. It originally comes from the ‘clew of thread’ which was to Theseus to use as a guide out of the Labyrinth in Greek mythology. This is a good example of a word gaining meaning, because nowadays, when you say “Give me a clue”, you don’t want a ball of yarn, you want some helpful information.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>4. Tattoo</h3><p>Tattoo comes from the Polynesian words&nbsp;ta-tau&nbsp;or&nbsp;ta-tu, both of which mean ‘mark on the skin’. It first popped up in&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">English</a></strong>&nbsp;in the late 18th century after Captain Cook returned to England from Tahiti, where he had seen people with lots of tattoos.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>5. Safari</h3><p>The Arabic word for ‘journey’ or ‘expedition’ is&nbsp;safar, and this is the origin of the word ‘safari’. The word travelled from Arabic into Swahili, and then on into English in the mid 19th century. It’s now used in English to talk about a journey into the wild to see&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">animals</a></strong>&nbsp;in their natural environments.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>6. Hooch</h3><p>‘Hooch’ is a slang word for alcohol in English, especially strong alcohol which is brewed illegally at home. It’s a shortened form of&nbsp;Hoochinoo, which was the name of an indigenous Alaskan group who made liquor. This so-called hooch (which was apparently pretty nasty tasting) became popular with miners during the 1898 Klondike gold rush and the word has remained in&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">English</a></strong>&nbsp;since.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>7. Barbarian</h3><p>This word comes from Ancient Greek; originally&nbsp;barbaros, it was used to talk about anyone who didn’t speak Greek. This is because the sounds made by foreigners sounded like ‘ba-ba-ba’ to Greek ears. Its negative meaning was added by the Romans, who called any&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">foreigners</a></strong>&nbsp;who didn’t follow Roman traditions ‘barbarians’.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>8. Berserk&nbsp;</h3><p>Quite a few words in English also come from the Viking language of Old Norse. ‘Berserk’ is one of these words. It is used in modern English to mean ‘furiously violent or angry’. It’s probably from the Norse words&nbsp;ber&nbsp;‘bear’ and&nbsp;serkr&nbsp;‘shirt’, literally ‘a warrior clothed in bearskin’.&nbsp;</p><p>Which words in your language do you think share etymological roots with English ones?</p><p><h2 class=headline>Ready to start learning with Lingoda?</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Laura-1.jpg><h2>Laura Jones</h2><p>Laura is a freelance writer and was an ESL teacher for eight years.
