Particularly my good friend on the APC side, on the same level,” he stated.</p><p>“When people think they have money, they have power, and the sitting authority is theirs, there’s no limit. Someone has to tap them on the shoulder. I did it and I pointed a finger. You do it again—do one, I’ll do three. You know I’m capable of doing it.</p><p>“They’ve stopped. However, me and my family have been paying a huge price for my attempts to rescue Nigeria. They sent all sorts of people after me.”</p><p>“But the thing that I was able to sort [out] with the [opposing] presidential and vice presidential candidate, I ended up suffering on a much lesser level.</p><p>“Thirty-five years ago, at least, our dad of blessed memory passed away. No one ever insulted him until I joined the elections for presidency. This is not fair. It doesn’t happen anywhere in the world.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>“You don’t insult people’s parents or their families. It’s a huge price for anyone to pay.”</p><p>The Vice Presidential candidate while condemning the attacks on his family particularly his late father was so moved to tears that he stepped out of the hall to regain his composure.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdku6bD0minqKSZqbakv46bmJuZXZa1rrHDZqSorpWZerW7jK2cmqqjYry3sdFmoKerpaHBtHnTqGShoaNis6LAx56pZq%2BYpHqltcSdZGxtXa6yor7SZpigp19psHO0mLKw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-ariana-grande-paid-homage-to-paula-abdul-in-yes-and-music-video.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How Ariana Grande Paid Homage to Paula Abdul in &amp;quot;Yes, And?&amp;quot; Music Video</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./8-plants-that-can-be-dangerous-to-touch-and-how-to-recognize-them-802696.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>8 Plants That Can Be Dangerous to Touch and How to Recognize Them</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fontainebleau.html>Fontainebleau: Worlds Greatest Places 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-much-money-does-yung-joc-make-html.html>How Much Money Does Yung Joc Make?
