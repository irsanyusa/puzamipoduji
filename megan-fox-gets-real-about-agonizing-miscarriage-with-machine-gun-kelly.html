The Jennifer’s Body actress recently talked about the “very difficult” miscarriage experience she suffered with fiancé Machine Gun Kelly.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-megan-fox-opens-up-about-miscarriage-in-her-first-poetry-book>Megan Fox Opens Up About Miscarriage in Her First Poetry Book</h2><p>Confessing her pains, Fox revealed her unfortunate miscarriage in two poems off her new book, Pretty Boys Are Poisonous. The actress elaborated on the experience during her recent sit-down interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Good Morning America</a>.</p><p>“I’ve never been through anything like that before in my life,” she said. “I have three kids. So it was very difficult for both of us, and it sent us on a very wild journey together.”</p><p>Fox went on and added that she and Kelly have found the loss uneasy to navigate even individually. Reeling from the heartbreak, she had to mentally wrestle around the questions “What does this mean?” and “Why did this happen?”</p><p>“I want to hold your hand / hear your laugh,” and later, “but now / I have to say / goodbye.” Another line is about imagining holding the baby “as they rip you from my insides,” she writes. “I will pay any price / Tell me please / what is the ransom / for her soul?”</p><p>Fox shares 10-year-old Noah, nine-year-old Bodhi and six-year-old Journey with ex-husband Brian Austin Green. Previously, Green and his fiancée Sharna Burgess shared that they have a great <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">co-parenting relationship</a> with Fox, noting that Fox sometimes hang out with them when she’s dropping off or picking up the kids.</p><p>While her poetry book is truly revealing of her personal struggles, Fox clarified that Pretty Boys Are Poisonous is not a tea she is willingly letting the world to see. Rather, it is a message to empower other women to speak up.</p><p>“It gives an elegant place for your pain to live,” she said. “To put it into art makes it useful to other people, and so you don’t just suffer with it on your own.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-tackles-one-abusive-relationship-in-one-poem>She Tackles One Abusive Relationship in One Poem</h2><p>Overall, Pretty Boys Are Poisonous features 70 sets of poems, entirely based on her candid experiences. In one piece, Fox bravely discussed one phase of her life where she revealed being in a physically abusive relationship in the past. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fox</a>, however, refused to disclose the name of that former partner.</p><p>“I’ve only been publicly connected to a few people that I shared energy with, I guess we could say, who were her horrific people and also very famous people,” she said. “But no one knows that I was involved with those people.”</p><p>The Transformers star also revealed that Kelly encouraged her to create the book. Her fiancé, whom she refers to as her “twin flame,” is talked about in her poem titled “To Marry an Arsonist.”</p><p>Elsewhere in her interview, Fox also stated that there were some poems who didn’t make it to the book. According to her, she deliberately chose not to include them because they were too revealing.</p><p>“I wrote a lot of things that didn’t make it because I was like, ‘This is maybe for God’s eyes only,'” she said. “Some of it is too much when you’re a known person. If I had the freedom of just being a poet, and people not really wanting to dig too much into my personal life, I would have included more entries like that.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Original_GabbyBarrett_Todd-Williamson_NBC-220x147.jpg alt="‘American Idol’ Star Gabby Barrett Announces Her Second Studio Album ‘Chapter & Verse’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Machine Gun Kelly</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Megan Fox</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJ6emqZdm7y5ecaeq6xlopqurXnAm6aurF2WtLC6yLOgp59dora0r8CrqaKZl5p6uLXToWSmmZOdtq%2BxjKCsp2WbmrmtxY4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./plateforme-accompagnement-prise-en-charge-des-frais-la-justice-economique-veut-aider-les.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Plateforme, accompagnement, prise en charge des frais la justice conomique veut aider les entre</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./instruction-des-autorisations-durbanisme-et-ingenierie-publique-les-contours-de-la-reforme-se.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>les contours de la rforme se prcisent</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fontainebleau.html>Fontainebleau: Worlds Greatest Places 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-much-money-does-yung-joc-make-html.html>How Much Money Does Yung Joc Make?
