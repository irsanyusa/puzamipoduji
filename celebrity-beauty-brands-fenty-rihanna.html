In recent years, many famous faces, including Drew Barrymore and Jennifer Lopez, have turned to the cosmetics industry.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">But recent Morning Consult data shows that consumers are largely unaware of — and uninterested in — celebrity beauty brands, with a few notable exceptions.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>What the numbers say&nbsp;</strong></h2><ul class="mb-m ml-m text-body-large"><li class="list-disc list-outside mb-s last:mb-0">Consumers were largely unaware of celebrity cosmetics brands, according to the survey, though respondents were most aware of Rihanna’s Fenty Beauty, which launched in 2017. Thirty-one percent of respondents said they’d seen, read or heard either “a lot” or “some” about the Grammy Award-winning singer’s beauty line. JLo Beauty by Jennifer Lopez (28 percent) and KKW Beauty by Kim Kardashian West (24 percent) were also relatively known among consumers.&nbsp;</li><li class="list-disc list-outside mb-s last:mb-0">Fenty Beauty was the most-known brand among both women (36 percent) and men (25 percent), as well as among Gen Zers (46 percent) and millennials (49 percent). Gen Xers (31 percent) were most aware of Lopez’s JLo Beauty.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li class="list-disc list-outside mb-s last:mb-0">Roughly 3 in 4 Americans (74 percent) said they’re not interested in purchasing beauty products from celebrity brands. Among that group, roughly one-third (32 percent) said they aren’t interested because they are not a fan of celebrities that have beauty brands. A nearly equal share (31 percent) said they do not trust celebrities to have well-made beauty products.&nbsp;</li><li class="list-disc list-outside mb-s last:mb-0">Younger consumers showed the greatest interest in purchasing from celebrity cosmetics brands. Forty-four percent of millennials and 34 percent of Gen Zers said they were interested in purchasing products from beauty brands created and promoted by celebrities, compared to 31 percent of Gen Xers and just 7 percent of baby boomers.</li></ul><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>The impact&nbsp;</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Celebrity-branded products only work when consumers are aware of the business and are interested in purchasing from it, which, according to the data, are bad signs for the majority of celebrities hoping to strike gold with beauty lines. Rihanna’s Fenty Beauty seems best positioned moving forward, particularly among the coveted cohort of young consumers, in part because she and the brand have seemingly figured out what consumers in 2022 are looking for in a beauty brand, regardless of celebrity status.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The influential artist’s cosmetics line, which is reportedly <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>worth an estimated $1.4 billion</a>, first gained attention for its diverse foundation shades (the brand now sells foundation in 50 different shades) and has also expanded to include clothing in an inclusive range of sizes. Partnering with Amazon.com Inc’s Prime Video to broadcast several of her high-energy, star-studded fashion shows has helped visibility as well. Based on Fenty’s success, if celebrities want to make a mark on the beauty industry, they’ll need to do more than put their name on a product and hope it sells.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large"><i>The </i><a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#><i>survey</i></a><i> was conducted Dec. 3-6, 2021, among 2,200 U.S. adults, with a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6zwMico56rX5iyrbHBq6CtsV2XsqLB07Jkm6qRo7G0ecWepa2xXae2qa3Np5g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./a-teenager-who-went-viral-after-pushing-her-friend-off-a-60ft-high-bridge-was.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>A teenager who went viral after pushing her friend off a 60ft high bridge was sentenced to 2 days in</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kevin-macdonald-erik-matti-barbara-albert-1235947077.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Scotlands Kevin Macdonald, The Philippines Erik Matti and Austrias Barbara Albert Tak</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fontainebleau.html>Fontainebleau: Worlds Greatest Places 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-much-money-does-yung-joc-make-html.html>How Much Money Does Yung Joc Make?
