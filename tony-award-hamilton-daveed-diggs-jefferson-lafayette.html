Born in California in 1982 to a white, Jewish mother and an African-American father, Diggs forged his path into performing early on, studying theater at Brown, where he also became a track star. He spent years working as a hip hop artist, touring with his band <a href=# rel=noopener>Clipping</a> and even sleeping on the subway overnight when he couldn’t afford an apartment.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Now he’s on a first-name basis with the entire Obama family, has rapped for French President François Hollande and rubs shoulders with celebrity theatergoers like Beyonce, Jay Z and Jamie Foxx, to name a few.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“The incredible moments just keep piling up,” he said. “The entire day at the White House was pretty surreal. When the President says your name before you say his, it’s like, whoa.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Diggs plays Lafayette in the first act of the show, letting his wild hair down—literally—for the second act as a gaudy, somewhat charming version of Jefferson, for whom he gets regularly recognized on the street.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I think Jefferson’s the more recognizable character, he has more to do but also people like to choose favorites,” Diggs said. “There’s a Team Lafayette and a Team Jefferson.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Jefferson has been the more difficult character to embody, considering that the complicated president not only owned slaves, but most historians agree he fathered children with some of them.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“It’s tricky with Jefferson because there are so many things about him that I disagree with,” he said. “The way that we made him function in the show is to make him incredibly charismatic.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It’s this charisma that’s turned what was a small hip-hop-focused fan base of Diggs’ into a vast array of supporters ranging in all ages, races and genders.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“The funnier thing, the thing that perks my ears up, is the generational thing, when someone whose interests really predate hip hop, like someone who’s in their 70s, and they say I listened to all of your songs,” he said. “That’s a trip.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This trip he’s on is only speeding up, though, especially with his latest Tony nomination and <a href=# rel=noopener>Hamilton‘s record 16 nominations</a>. “I’ve been an artist for my whole life, and this happens to be the thing people know me for more than anything else, but for the smaller group of people who know me from before, they’re like, what are you doing?”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Diggs thinks of what he’s doing as reclaiming history, both for audiences and for himself.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The impact Lafayette’s and Jefferson’s legacies have on Diggs is unbelievable to the actor—shortly after his interview with TIME, he headed to Christie’s to handle Lafayette’s pistols before they were auctioned off. And in a more somber way, he said he felt a stronger connection to his French character the day of the Paris attacks.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Toward the end of the first act I’m yelling ‘Freedom for America, freedom for France,’ and there is this political and military bond between France and the United states that I didn’t know much about before the show,” Diggs said. “I was definitely feeling things that night on stage and there were a lot more emotions, I was tearing up.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The emotions, whether happy or sad, are only inflated by a supporting cast that’s grown to be as close as a family. Lin-Manuel Miranda, the show’s star and creator, is definitely “the oracle” of the family, Diggs says, while Anthony Ramos, who plays John Laurens and Hamilton’s first son Phillip, is “little brother.” Chris Jackson, who plays George Washington, is “pops, full of pearls of wisdom and great advice,” while Renée Elise Goldsberry, who plays Angelica Schuyler, is “kind of the cool aunt.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“But the great thing about all of these people is that whatever role they’re taking backstage, on stage they are the most giving people. All of the hierarchy disappears,” Diggs said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">His role in the family he’s not even sure of, calling himself the lost puppy dog who’s always slightly befuddled. He said he looks up to Phillipa Soo, who, starring as Eliza Hamilton, sings a line in the show directing her family to “look around at how lucky [they] are to be alive right now.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Diggs is looking around. He just can’t believe his luck.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZtamhshXqEjq2mp7FdlsSivsNmn5qlmaHBsLqMnZivnZWZeqW1xqCqZqKVm7OmvtKopWakkZuuurHTrZxo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./gen-z-banking-finance-data-trends.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Why Gen Zers Are More Likely to Open New Bank Accounts</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./la-div-veut-faire-descendre-les-femmes-dans-la-rue.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>La DIV veut faire descendre les femmes dans la rue</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fontainebleau.html>Fontainebleau: Worlds Greatest Places 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-much-money-does-yung-joc-make-html.html>How Much Money Does Yung Joc Make?
