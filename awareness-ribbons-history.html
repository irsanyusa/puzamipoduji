It’s a ritual that repeats itself for any number of causes, such as teal ribbons for ovarian cancer to red ribbons for AIDS awareness.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But when did ribbons begin to be used as symbols for various causes?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Library of Congress’s Folklife Center has studied the history of such awareness ribbons in American culture, and found that many citizens assume that the tradition is older than it is. Among the most frequently asked questions posed to librarians on the topic is whether families of Civil War soldiers displayed ribbons for missing loved ones during the Civil War, a theory often informed by the 1949 John Wayne film <a href=# rel=noopener>She Wore a Yellow Ribbon</a>. That movie’s story was inspired by a military ditty in which the yellow ribbon appears as a symbol for a far-away lover. That song dates back to the mid-19th century but the center argues that the roots of awareness ribbons can be traced to a much more recent pop-culture reference.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In 1973, Tony Orlando and Dawn released the record <a href=# rel=noopener>“Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree,” </a>written by Irwin Levine and L. Russell Brown. It reportedly sold three million <a href=# rel=noopener>records</a> within the first three weeks of its release. The tune is about a recently released prisoner who sings that his sweetheart should tie a yellow ribbon around an oak tree if she stills loves him, but the lyrics about an anticipated reunion <a href=# rel=noopener>struck a chord</a> with Vietnam prisoners of war who had <a href=#>returned home</a> earlier that year and attended the Cotton Bowl in Dallas where the artists opened for comedian Bob Hope.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Soon enough, people were actually tying yellow ribbons around trees.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Notably, a few years later, Penne Laingen tied a yellow ribbon around a tree in her Bethesda, Md., yard while she waited for her husband Bruce Laingen. He had been charge d’affaires at the U.S. embassy in Tehran and was one of <a href=# rel=noopener>66 American hostages</a> seized by Iranian students on Nov. 4, 1979. On Dec. 10, 1979, the Washington Post <a href=# rel=noopener>reported</a> that she suggested others do the same. Other families of hostages followed suit, and sympathetic Americans too. Even the hostages themselves Kathryn Koob and Elizabeth Ann Swift were wearing yellow ribbons in their hair in a Christmas-themed propaganda video released around the holidays, TIME <a href=#>reported</a>. By the time the hostages were en route home the next month, after 444 days, “Yellow ribbons were tied to virtually everything that could not or would not resist: trees, lampposts, TV cameras, trumpets, drums, pretty girls, the hostages’ homes and public buildings, including the White House.” It was, TIME reported, “a traditional American symbol of separated sweethearts.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The yellow ribbons would also be tied to trees during the<a href=#> TWA Flight 847 hostage crisis</a> in 1985 and during the <a href=#>First Gulf War</a> in 1990 and 1991. The latter conflict coincided with a key moment for AIDS activism, and thus the yellow ribbons <a href=# rel=noopener>inspired</a> advocates to create a red ribbon to raise awareness about the disease. Jeremy Irons popularized the idea by wearing a red ribbon when he <a href=# rel=noopener>hosted</a> the Tony Awards on Jun. 2, 1991.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Shortly after, reportedly inspired by those other awareness ribbons, Charlotte Haley, a 68-year-old housewife in Simi Valley, Calif., created a peach-colored ribbon that she hoped could raise awareness about breast cancer, the disease that her grandmother, sister and daughter had. At the local supermarket, she handed them out in <a href=# rel=noopener>packets of five</a> attached to a postcard that read: “The National Cancer Institute’s annual budget is $1.8 billion, only 5 percent goes for cancer prevention. Help us wake up legislators and America by wearing this ribbon.” By May 1992, The New York Times had already dubbed that year <a href=# rel=noopener>“The Year of the Ribbon.”</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">While the Susan G. Komen Foundation <a href=# rel=noopener>says</a> it began handing out pink ribbons at its first Race for the Cure in Oct. 1991, the pink ribbon became even more popular after Self magazine featured it on the cover of that month’s issue and partnered with the businesswoman and philanthropist Evelyn Lauder to hand out 1.5 million pink ribbons at Estée Lauder makeup counters. Eventually, the association with the cause spread beyond the ribbon to the color pink itself. In 2006, TIME <a href=#>reported</a> that Komen’s partnerships with pink promoters raked in $30 million a year.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">By now, <a href=# rel=noopener>awareness ribbons</a> are such a ubiquitous idea that some businesses have been accused of trying to cash in on the enthusiasm they generate. <a href=# rel=noopener>“Pinkwashing”</a> has come to refer to the process of using the color pink to generate goodwill while only making some minimal or perfunctory contribution to the actual cause of breast-cancer research and awareness. “In other words, take off those rose-tinted glasses,” TIME <a href=#>advised</a> readers in 2006, “ask questions and read the fine, pink print.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZubGBthnOFjpqumqqVo7K0v4yroJuan6PAbrTIrKuoqqlk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-our-favorite-hollywood-celebrities-looked-like-before-they-got-famous-799321.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Our Favorite Hollywood Celebrities Looked Like Before They Got Famous</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tinashe-nasty-match-my-freak.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tinashe on the Takeover of &amp;quot;Nasty&amp;quot;</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fontainebleau.html>Fontainebleau: Worlds Greatest Places 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-much-money-does-yung-joc-make-html.html>How Much Money Does Yung Joc Make?
